	<Name>Dungeon Stalker</Name>
	<Plot>Everyone knows "The Dungeon," the last subterranean vestige of a long collapsed and long forgotten castle. The children of your village have always loved to scare each other with songs of skeletal warriors, a thousand years dead, that stalk its silent corridors. As children become adults and traditions grow, it has become the custom for boys on the verge of manhood to prove their worth, venturing into the darkness to retrieve some small trinket. Usually it's just a few old coins picked up near the entrance, along with a hastily concocted story of bravery and derring-do. As your seventeenth birthday approached, it was clear that it was never going to be a straightforward cash grab for you. As eldest daughter of the chieftain, you always had a lot more to prove; always the best shot, the best sword, the fastest rider and the bravest warrior. That's why you're down here; shivering, terrified and pointing a loaded arrow at anything that moves. And things are moving in the darkness. At first it was just the bats, but as you venture deeper, the unmistakable sound of footsteps echoes in the gloom - bone footsteps. The children's songs were right - the dead do stalk these halls! Welcome to Dungeon Stalker. Get ready for an exciting arcade-style adventure; fighting monsters and collecting treasure as you journey ever deeper into the Dungeon!</Plot>
