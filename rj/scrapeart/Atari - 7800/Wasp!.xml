	<Name>Wasp!</Name>
	<ReleaseDate>2009</ReleaseDate>
	<Plot>It's The Enchanted Land's annual Mushroom Soup Festival. While out in the woods collecting mushrooms you stumble across a nest of Giant Killer Wasps. With no giants to kill they make a wasp line for... YOU! Wasp! is Mark Ball's first foray into Atari 7800 programming, and is (as far as we're aware) the first 7800 game written in the C programming language. Wasp! was originally written as a demo, but quickly evolved into a playable game. Your goal in Wasp! is fairly simple--collect as many mushrooms as you can while avoiding the angry wasps! How long can you survive their flying wrath?</Plot>
