When the bell rings, he charges like a man insane. Just before the impact of his 386-pound body, you step aside and raise your elbow.  Perfect elbow smash! Bruno falls to the mat. You get him in a head lock, but his shaved head slips free. Then you see it. The famous Bruno the Sledge "Eye of Terror," the look of death. You're in trouble now!  Mat Mania Challenge provides all the thrills and spills of professional wrestling. Do you have what it takes to survive brain busters and pile drivers? If you have the skills, the championship belt will be yours!</Plot>
