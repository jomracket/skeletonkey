	<plot>Your Dad got you an after-school job at the factory where he works.  You need the money 'cuz being the most radical boarder around means you've got heavy expenses.
The job is a skateboarder's dream come true.  Miles of halls and tubes to perfect your moves.  Just cruise through and turn off all the machines and lights in the factory.  Hurry up 'cuz power is leaking out fast!
Naturally, there's a catch.  You get paid depending on how much power you save.  And you've got to be out of the factory by 5:15 pm today.  One second more and you'll never make the deadline for entering the Skateboarding Championship.</plot>
