	<Plot>Santa's workshop elves need a sharp mind if they are to correctly build the millions of toys needed for Christmas every year. With that in mind, Santa has developed a program he calls Santa Simon to help the elves improve their memory. The premise is pretty simple--all you need to do is remember the sequence that the Christmas Tree, Reindeer, Snowman and Santa signal to you and then play back that sequence in the proper order using your joystick controller. How many moves can you memorize before slipping up?</Plot>
