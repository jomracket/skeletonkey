	<Plot>You are about to embark on one of the most dangerous missions of your career. As a renowned Star Fleet pilot, you have been selected to command an exploration party in a journey across the galaxy to investigate the mysterious planet JINKS. An enigma for centuries, JINKS is a lush, resource-rich world, and could be the key to the desperate need for human expansion in space. It is apparently capable of supporting life, yet it is curiously uninhabited--or is it?  A routine research mission goes haywire when scouting your probe across the planet's surface leads you and your crew into a deadly game of cat and mouse. Can you escape from these fiendishly clever traps before your probe and its occupants are miniaturized or annihilated?</Plot>
