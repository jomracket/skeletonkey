	<Name>Cal Ripken Jr. Baseball (USA)</Name>
	<plot>Cal Ripken Jr. 1991's Most Valuable Player in the American League. One of only twenty players in Major League Baseball to be MVP twice. An 'iron man' in the majors, playing in over 1,600 consecutive games. When Cal plays, he plays for real! Cal Ripken Jr. Baseball brings that realism home. You'll get unequalled animation, accurate strategy-logic and players that respond to real game situations. You also get all-new, all-star features you won't find anywhere else: Choose your home field -domed, traditional outdoor or one tailored to power hitters. Play on natural grass or artificial turf and get accurate game play effects. Watch cutaway camera angles for realistic close-ups of the game action. Use Cal as a pinch-hitter for either team during the game - or create an 'all-Cal' team that can challenge the best of them.Cheat: Hidden Build Date and CreditsPress and hold Left+A+B on the Mindscape logo screen.Cheat: Hidden Build Date and CreditsSelect Exhibition Game.
