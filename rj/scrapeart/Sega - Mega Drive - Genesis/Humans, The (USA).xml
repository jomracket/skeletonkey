	<Name>Humans, The (USA)</Name>
	<plot>'Just what the heck are HUMANS?... and what are they doing in a video game anyhow?' We know... we've heard it before, they're strange... they're ugly... they're stupid. But there's more to these HUMANS than meets the eye, for inside each and every one of them is a small but usable brain. Working as a team and discovering new tools is the key to survival in this cruel world of chaos and carnivores. It's an action-filled race against time, where you score points by finishing levels with as many of your tribesmen intact as HUMAN-ly possible (which isn't that easy when it comes down to survival of the fittest). With Gametek's Sega Genesis version of HUMANS, the only missing link is you!</plot>
