	<plot>This isn't just a fast game... IT'S THE FASTEST RACING GAME EVER ON GENESIS! In Formula One, your car could reach a blistering 200mph - and it's speed you can feel. And if that's not fast enough for your lead foot, check out our Turbo Mode - kick in the afterburners and scream past the grandstands at a cool 220! Only Formula One by Domark can give you that rush. Strap on your helmet and buckle-up 'cause you're gonna race against the real pros of Formula One World Championship - on 12 international circuits including England's super-fast Silverstone raceway and the world famous Monaco track at Monte Carlo. Or, go head-to-head against a friend using our simultaneous split-screen technology. Either way, use your experience to 'dial-in' wing adjustment and tire style to maximize performance on each track for an experience so real you may forget to take a pit stop...</plot>

	<Notes>F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult.  There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want.</Notes>
