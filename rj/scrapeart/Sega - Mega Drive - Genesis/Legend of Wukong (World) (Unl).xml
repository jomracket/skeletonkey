Pursued by hordes of fierce demons, will he survive long enough to retrieve the time machine and return home?During the course of the adventure, players take control of a young, monkey-faced boy named Wukong who goes in search of his time machine in order to return to the year 1996. Along the way he is joined by Pigsy, a man-pig hybrid, and Wujing, a kind and beautiful young girl.While the game's story is rooted in the popular Chinese legend of the Journey to the West, many of the details have been uniquely re-imagined to make the game fresh and to keep gamers from knowing just what will happen next.</plot>
