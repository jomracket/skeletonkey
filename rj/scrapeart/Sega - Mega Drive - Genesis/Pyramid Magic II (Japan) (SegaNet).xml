	<plot>Pyramid Magic II is a direct continuation of the first game. In the final room of the first title, the intrepid young explorer finds a stone tablet, which directs him to another part of the pyramid. He must now make his way back through the pyramid, once more in search of the treasure. The gameplay elements are identical to the first game: collect the keys and reach the exit of each room without crushing or trapping the explorer. The ability to skip two stages returns, and there are 35 new puzzles to solve.Cheat: Level passwordsSelect "Password" on the title screen and input these numbers:</plot>

	<Notes>Pyramid Magic II (ピラミッドマジックII) is a puzzle-platform game for the Sega Mega Drive, released exclusively in Japan via the Sega Game Toshokan service. Pyramid Magic II claims to be a "sequel" to Pyramid Magic, though is more of a continuation of the original game, with identical graphics, sounds and gameplay. It even shows the Pyramid Magic levels on the map screen. The difference is that Pyramid Magic II offers harder levels.</Notes>
