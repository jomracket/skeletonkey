	<Notes>Doraemon: Yume Dorobou to 7 Nin no Gozans (ドラえもん 夢どろぼうと７人のゴザンス) is a 1993 platformer by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive tying into the Doraemon media franchise. B jumps. C shoots your gun, which stuns enemies so you can safely jump on them and use them as platforms. The longer you hold C, the more powerful your shots get; sufficiently powerful shots can destroy enemies.</Notes>
