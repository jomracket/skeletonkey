	<Name>Super Real Basketball (Japan, Korea)</Name>
	<plot>Fast break for big-time hoop play with Pat Riley Basketball! This is backboard-slamming action at its hottest! You coach the team or be any player the situation demands. Gunshot passes, sneaky steals, dazzling tactics - this game's got it all! Shop for your favorite club from a league of 8 teams, each with its own strengths. Scout your challengers in exhibition play. Then hit the court to the screams of a packed house! Eyeball your team's performance and switch player positions as needed. Closeups capture the on-court intensity - jump balls, free throws, 3-point jumpers, and airborne slams! Face off at center court with the computer or duke it out with a friend. Throw some bombs in tournament play, then slam dunk your way to the championship!</plot>
