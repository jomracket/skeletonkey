	<Plot>Originally created for PC by John Bell (Lazy Brain Games) Bug Hunt had already proved very popular on the NEC PC-Engine in the Neo Coding Compo in 2013. It is now time for the 16-bit SEGA to get a version of the game and what’s more, it’s free! This is once again courtesy of Afromonkeys (Jack Nolddor and Davidian), who, as usual, have also given us a quality conversion. We had already mentioned Chase, a NES game portage by the same creators, which proved to be a pleasant surprise. Note that this version of Bug Hunt is compatible with the Mega Mouse so that you can enjoy the same experience as the PC version.</Plot>
