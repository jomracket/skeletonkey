	<plot>Fast break for big-time hoop play with Pat Riley Basketball! This is backboard-slamming action at its hottest! You coach the team or be any player the situation demands. Gunshot passes, sneaky steals, dazzling tactics - this game's got it all! Shop for your favorite club from a league of 8 teams, each with its own strengths. Scout your challengers in exhibition play. Then hit the court to the screams of a packed house! Eyeball your team's performance and switch player positions as needed. Closeups capture the on-court intensity - jump balls, free throws, 3-point jumpers, and airborne slams! Face off at center court with the computer or duke it out with a friend. Throw some bombs in tournament play, then slam dunk your way to the championship!</plot>

	<Notes>Super Real Basketball uses a scrolling court-side view to recreate the game, with 8 teams representing major US cities.These can play in Exhibition and Tournament matches, with a 2-player mode and 3 skill levels. Before each match you can choose between zonal and man-to-man marking, and this can be changed after each quarter, or during a time out. Physical contact fouls is impossible although 'traveling' is called. Tip-offs and Slam-Dunk attempts switch to a 3D close-up view, and are controlled by hammering the B button as hard as possible - on occasion you can get defense players in to block an attempted dunk.</Notes>
