	<plot>"Snakes! Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?"The nest of deadly snakes has been disturbed by seismic experiments in a remote location. Now the snakes are slithering to the surface, causing confused terror in attacks on everything that crosses their path.There is a way to control this madness, but it's not going to be easy. The snakes from this nest tend to eat snakes of the same color and design. If you can guide the slithering masses so that snakes of the same type meet and eliminate each other, then the world could be saved from this snake infestation.It's all up to you! Guide the snakes, find matching pairs and keep the population under control!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2HGU-6dAhMhttp://www.consoleclassix.com/snes/wild_snake.html</plot>

	<Notes>WildSnake is a puzzle game released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy in 1994. Both Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear versions of WildSnake were advertised for release, but both were cancelled for unknown reasons. Pototypes of both have since surfaced. Advertising saw Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov lend his name to the game, however Pajitnov was not involved in its development.</Notes>
