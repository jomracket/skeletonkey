	<plot>Pyramid Magic III is the final title in the Pyramid Magic series of puzzle adventure games, and picks up right where the second game left off. Our hero is still inside of the same pyramid, but is finally nearing the treasure he seeks! Unfortunately, it would appear that the final step requires a large, heavy, fragile jug filled with some kind of liquid. He must now find a way to take this jug to where his treasure awaits.While the basic concept remains the same, the game is made more difficult by the addition of the jug. The jug is fragile: if it is kicked or dropped any distance, it will break and the stage must be restarted. However, it is also dangerous: much like the stone blocks, if the explorer falls even one square while carrying it, he will be crushed by its weight. In each puzzle, the player must collect all of the keys to open the door, but he must also reach the door while carrying the jug with him in order to proceed. There are a total of 30 puzzles to solve, and once again the player is allowed to "pass" twice.Cheat: Level passwordsSelect "Password" on the title screen and input these numbers:</plot>

	<Notes>Pyramid Magic III (ピラミッドマジックIII) is a puzzle-platform game for the Sega Mega Drive, released exclusively in Japan via the Sega Game Toshokan service. Pyramid Magic III is a "sequel" to Pyramid Magic II, and like Pyramid Magic II offers little more in terms of upgrades other than harder levels.</Notes>
