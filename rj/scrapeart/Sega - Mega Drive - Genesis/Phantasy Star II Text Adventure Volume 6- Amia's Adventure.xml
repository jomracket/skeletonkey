	<Name>Phantasy Star II Text Adventure Volume 6- Amia's Adventure</Name>
	<ReleaseDate>1991</ReleaseDate>
	<Plot>The game takes place in Autumn of AW 1282, about 2 years before the events of Phantasy Star II. The emergence of biomonsters was soon followed by a new class of warriors called hunters. Hunters devote themselves to protecting the people of Mota from attack. Anna Zirski (アーミア・アミルスキー (Āmia Amirusuki, Amia Amirski)), however, is a hunter of a different sort - one who hunts hunters, those who have gone rogue and become as much of a threat as the monsters themselves. This chapter details Anna's origin as a bounty hunter, and follows her chase for a wanted Motavian hacker. Her adventure in pursuit of this criminal leads her to find out about her target's remorseful past, inspiring her to renounce her bounty hunting career, and instead becoming a 'Counter Hunter' - choosing to focus her efforts on hunters that have gone truly bad, rather than dutifully arresting anyone with a bounty on their head.</Plot>
