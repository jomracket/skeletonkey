	<plot>Winter Challenge is a video game that portrays seven winter sports that are competed in during the Winter Olympics. This game however was not endorsed by the International Olympic Committee, the United States Olympic Committee, or any similar organization for any other country. It was released for the Mega Drive/Genesis.Gameplay::Most of the games consisted of using the directional pad for steering, and the A, B, and C buttons for performing certain functions like shooting, running, braking, or pushing off, as you would for the ski jump. Button mashing was necessary as times for a couple of the events, but most were focused on timing and accuracy. The ski jump was scored by distance, and the biathlon was scored by time and shooting accuracy. All the other events were scored by time.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Challenge</plot>
