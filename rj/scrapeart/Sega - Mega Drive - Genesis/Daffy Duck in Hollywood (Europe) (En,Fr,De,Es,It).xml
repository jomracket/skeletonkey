	<plot>Uh-oh! Mad Professor Duckbrain has stolen Yosemite Sam's previous golden movie awards, and he wants a million bucks for 'em! What to do? Well, call Daffy Duck of course! Daffy grabs his trusty bubble gun and explores different film sets to retrieve the awards. But watch out! The film sets are also rigged with dynamite that must be deactived, or else Hollywood is sure to blow up! All of the film sets are themed after various adventurous movie genres and locations, including horror, western, jungle and sci-fi! Daffy can power up his bubble gun to fire an array of different bubbles, and enemies are defeated by capturing them in bubbles and having them float away. As another trick up his  sleeve, Daffy can call for help from a fairy duck mother, who flies around with Daffy and protects him.Cheat: Debug ModeEnter this code at the push start screen to view all movies and freeze the timer at 99.</plot>
