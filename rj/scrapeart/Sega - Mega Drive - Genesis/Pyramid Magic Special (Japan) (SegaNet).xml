	<plot>Want more Pyramid Magic? Pyramid Magic Special eschews the rather thin story of the series and simply offers more puzzles to solve. Just like always, the player is cast as an explorer seeking a hidden treasure, who must make his way through each room, collecting all the keys, without either trapping or crushing himself in the process. This installment offers another 35 puzzles to solve. These new puzzles are exceptionally challenging, designed for those who found the other titles too easy, and the player is even given three passes instead of the usual two.Cheat: Level passwordsSelect "Password" on the title screen and input these numbers:</plot>

	<Notes>Pyramid Magic Special (ピラミッドマジック特別) is a puzzle-platform game for the Sega Mega Drive, released exclusively in Japan via the Sega Game Toshokan service. Pyramid Magic Special is essentially a re-tooled version of the original Pyramid Magic, with identical graphics, gameplay and music. The levels are mostly the same also, but generally have more obstacles to make them less straight forward.</Notes>
