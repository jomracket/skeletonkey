	<plot>Plot:We follow Puggsy who has crash landed on an alien planet 15 light years away from his home planet. The inhabitants of the planet have stolen his spaceship which stops him from being able to find his way home.You find your way through many levels where there is no set path and you can find your own way around, with the main objective of getting your spaceship back from 'The Racoons'Gameplay:Puggsy is a platformer, which means it works pretty much in the same way as others: Up, Down, Left, Right, Pick up, Put down, Throw. However, many of the levels involve puzzles which are required in order to progress.Puggsy uses Total Object Interaction which is the system that allows real world physics to come into play. Certain objects in the game can be picked up and used in some way to help you complete the level. You can even stack objects, such as barrels to help you reach the higher platforms. You can also throw these objects at the enemies, or even pick up a gun and shoot them. Also, the object you carry will make you weigh more, so you wont be able to jump as high depending on your weight. Each object has a different weight to it, from a balloon that will help you float to a weight that will sink you quickly.The goal of each level is to reach the exit. Optionally, you may bring items with you through the exit door to give you more points. Often times levels will involve finding a key and unlocking a chest to reach the most valuable item to take back with you. If you're crafty, you can bring multiple things in the doorway with you, netting you those precious extra points. You can also replay any levels that you like, which is helpful if you need points or a pair of sunglasses or trainers for Puggsy.Special ItemsSunglasses - Not only used to look awesome, they act as a shield for one hit.Shield - Makes you temporarily invincible when activated.Trainers - When worn, provides a speed and jump height boost.

	<Notes>Puggsy is a platform game with a combination of action and puzzle-solving elements. You control the the creature Puggsy, who has crash landed on an alien planet and had his spaceship stolen. Your goal is find the spaceship so you can get off the planet and return home. To do this, you will need to make your way from the start to the exit of numerous levels which take place in a variety of environments. Throughout each level are a variety of objects which you can pick up; on many of the levels you will need to figure out how to use the objects available to you in order to reach the exit. Some objects can be used (like a gun or keys), and objects may be thrown, moved around and stacked. Of course, each level will also have a variety of bad guys wandering about which will cost Puggsy one of his lives if he's caught. On your quest there will also be six evil guardians which will need to be defeated before you get your spaceship back!</Notes>
