	<plot>Overview:Space Harrier II was one of two games released when the Mega Drive first launched in Japan on Oct. 29, 1988. The other launch title was Super Thunder Blade. Both of these games were also North American launch titles for the Genesis.Gameplay:Player have the ability to change the pitch of the Y-axis of the controller's directional pad, thus changing how the movement in-game works.There is also a rapid fire option available in the game that allows the player to just hold down the fire button to unleash a wave of laser rounds in succession rather than having to simply mash the fire buttons or employ to triple flap technique.There is a total of 14 level stages in Space Harrier II. The first 12 stages have a similar structure of sending a set number of enemy waves at the player and then ending it with a unique boss fight. The thirteenth stage, however, changes the formula. In this stage, the player must fight all twelve bosses in succession. Once the player manages to get past this stage, the fourteenth stage is the final battle with the Dark Harrier. Once the Dark Harrier is defeated, the game ends and player is given a text based epilogue saying that the good deed is done while also implying that the game can be played again because evil never sleeps.Cheat: Secret Options/Sound TestWait for the title screen to appear, then press Up, Down, Left, RIght, A.</plot>

	<Notes>HELP! Deep in the 214th sector of the universe, a distress signal is sent from a land in turmoil. Under attack and besieged by countless monstrous beings, Fantasyland is fighting a losing battle. But wait, help is on the way! The heroic Space Harrier has jettisoned into their time warp via intergalactic teleportation. Armed with the same laser blaster that made Space Harrier victorious in the Land of the Dragons, you've got a host of vicious enemies to destroy. Space phantoms, multi-headed reptiles and wicked wizards are just a few of the targets to set your sights on. And they're everywhere. So keep your eyes on 'em, shoot straight, and keep moving. One false move and it's the end for you and Fantasyland!</Notes>
