	<plot>Overview:The fourth of Koei's Sengoku era-set strategy games, Nobunaga's Ambition: The Lord of Darkness ("Nobunaga no Yabou: Bushou Fuuunroku", or "Nobunaga's Ambition: Record of Generals in Turbulent Times") is a war sim in which the player controls one of many daimyos (warlords) attempting to take over Japan. The game expands to cover all of Japan's territories, a feature introduced in the second game but dropped in the third, and introduces subordinate generals that assist the daimyo in battle and lend him their strength. The generals were originally introduced in Nobunaga's Ambition's sister series Romance of the Three Kingdoms.The game was released for the US SNES as Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness. However, it is simply known as Nobunaga's Ambition on the Genesis and isn't to be confused with the original NES/SNES Nobunaga's Ambition (which is actually the second in the series, as the first never left Japan).		</plot>
