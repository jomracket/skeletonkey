	<plot>The Universal Cybernetics Corporation's got a huge PR problem. Seems some morbid folks are calling the new domestic robot they've designed 'The Ripper' due to a nasty little technical defect - this robot likes to kill. Or is it an accident that the UCC happened to create a genetically engineered killing machine who also happens to have an insatiable appetite for human beings? Translated from the number one European hit CORPORATION, you're the Cyber Cop who's been chosen by the government to crack the complex security system of the UCC. Your mission: Confiscate the mutant robot they've designed as the ultimate weapon. Just remember Cyber Cop - you're completely on your own. Of course, you'll arm yourself with a whole arsenal of firepower - everything from hologram projectors to infra-red image intensifiers. If all goes well, you'll be a national hero. But if the droid guards, sleeping gas and autolock doors get the best of you - even your own mom will deny that she ever knew you!Cheat: PasswordGo to level five and enter and enter the following:Cheat: Slow enery restorationPause the game and wait for a long time.
