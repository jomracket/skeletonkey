	<plot>Non-stop play-by-play announcing pulls you off your seat and into the batter's box. Slug with your bat high like Ruben Sierra or hammer with Cecil Fielder's wide-open stance. Watch Ken Griffey Jr. scramble for shoe-string catches! 'Ironman' Cal Ripken Jr. dives for hard shots in the hole! Go to bat with Kirby Puckett, Roger 'The Rocket' Clemens, and 'Doc' Gooden. Sharpen your team with pinch hitters and ace relievers like Dennis Eckersley. Seasons stretch up to 162 games including pennant race. A bench-full of batting styles, searing pitcher control and Sega Sports Talk hit home with all the big league baseball you can handle. And Canseco's up next...</plot>

	<Notes>Super League '91 is a baseball simulation game, and the sequel to Super League (a.k.a. Tommy Lasorda Baseball). The game plays much the same as its predecessor, and includes Pennant Race, Open (Exhibition), and All Pro game modes. Unlike its predecessor, this version features an official NPB license, and thus includes all 12 Central and Pacific League teams, complete with player names and stats from the 1991 season. A reworked version of the game that includes audio commentary and MLB teams was released internationally as Sports Talk Baseball.</Notes>
