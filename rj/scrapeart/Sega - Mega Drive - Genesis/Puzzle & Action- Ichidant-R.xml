	<Plot>Puzzle &amp; Action: Ichidant-R (イチダントアール) is the sequel to Puzzle &amp; Action: Tant-R, and like its prequel is an arcade game released for Sega System C arcade hardware. The game later brought to Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear, with the latter being renamed Puzzle &amp; Action: Ichidant-R GG (イチダントア～ルＧＧ). So far the game has never been released outside of Japan (and South Korea). Like Tant-R, Ichidant-R is a series of timed minigames, represented in the graphical style seen in Bonanza Bros.. Ichidant-R was bundled with Quiz Rouka ni Tattensai! in Sega Ages Rouka ni Ichidant-R for the Sega Saturn, and it was also bundled with Tant-R as part of volume 6 in the Sega Ages 2500 series for the PlayStation 2. It was also released for the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2007. One final game in the Puzzle &amp; Action series, Puzzle &amp; Action: Treasure Hunt was released for Sega Titan Video arcade hardware in 1997.</Plot>
