The standard modes apply including exhibition that both has a single player and two-player option, a full 162-game season or skip straight to the playoffs or the World Series.  The Home Run Derby is also present along with award-winning sports announcer, Jack Buck, lending his voice talent for play-by-play commentary.  A password feature is present for players to continue their season at their leisure.Cheat: Play against Tengen TeamEnter ''TheChallenge'' as your password.

	<Notes>R.B.I. Baseball '94 refines the engine used in 1993's game by doubling the speed of play, updating player movement with rotoscoped animation, and adding new music and sound effects, including the voice of award-winning broadcaster Jack Buck. You can also play a full 162-game season complete with playoffs and world championships, although a password is required to continue progress. Eight hundred actual players (with stats based on the 1993 season) have been added with colorful portraits appearing whenever they step up to the plate. Despite the game not having a Major League Baseball license, all 28 teams from 1993 are represented by city name and ballparks have been modeled after authentic stadiums. Also featured are the rosters for every division winner since 1985 as well as the 1989-93 All-Star squads. Game modes include: Home Run Derby, Game Breakers, Practice, Single Game, Season and Create Teams.</Notes>
