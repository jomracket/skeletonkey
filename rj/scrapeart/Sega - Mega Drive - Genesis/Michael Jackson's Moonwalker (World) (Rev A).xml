	<Name>Michael Jackson's Moonwalker (World) (Rev A)</Name>
	<plot>Overview: Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is a     side-scroller released for the Sega Master System and Sega Genesis, loosely based on the film of the same name.   An arcade release running on the Mega-Tech (Mega Drive-based) hardware was later released and despite the identical name, was an entirely different game from the System 18-based    Michael Jackson's Moonwalker arcade game that had been released beforehand. Moonwalker puts players in the shoes of    Michael Jackson, tasked to rescue children who had been kidnapped by    Mr. Big and his army of  mobsters, vicious dobermans, and    zombies. To rescue the kids, Michael takes on the army of criminals with his dancing repertoire and theatrical magic.Gameplay: Hitting the attack button causes Michael to send out a fly kick, or throw up his arms in an exaggerated dance fashion. Each of these attacks would send out a burst of magic sparks that extend the range of the strike. Enemies struck by the magic will violently ricochet off the screen before collapsing (akin to the way enemies would go flying in  Battletoads ).  Michael could also use two special attacks to defeat enemies when overwhelmed. Lightly pressing the special attack button would cause Michael to  throw out his hat, which would cause enemies to    explode. However, holding the special attack button would cause all the enemies on screen to line up with Michael and dance to 16-bit renditions of Michael Jackson's most famous hits of the time, such as "Smooth Criminal", "Billie Jean", and "Thriller." These dances, once completed, would cause all enemies onscreen to collapse. Once Michael has located all the children in the level, Bubbles, Michael's pet monkey, would fly onscreen, sit on the player's shoulder, and point vaguely in the general direction of the level's    boss encounter. On some levels, Michael can catch a  magical star, transforming him into a    robot, rendering him invincible and capable of firing lasers and missiles to show the enemy no mercy. In the game's option menu it is possible to listen to all of Michael's songs featured in the game.Cheat: 15 LivesPress Up, Up, Down, Left, Right, A, A, C. Press these at the starting screen.Cheat: 15 LivesWith controller 2, hold up+left+A and press Start. At the press start title screen use controller 1 and press start. Now, when you choose a game you can select a stage but not the subsection (ex. 1-2, 1-3 etc.)Cheat: Skip robot battle in round 5-3It isn't necessary to turn into a robot in order to beat round 5-3. All you have to do is a dance attack affecting 8 or more enemies.  After Mr.Big leaves the scene, and before that little freeze that happens before every boss fight, take a jump and before Michael lands press the magic button.  Keep moving while spinning to where there are more green guards until MJ starts dancing. Getting 8 or more guys dancing will make you win the battle.  If you want to, press one of the buttons during the explosion, to make the star fall and turn you into a robot for no reason. In this stage, hitting any button during the fight causes the star to appears, so the trick is doing so BEFORE the battle begins, the jumping thing is just to get you more time to gather enough enemies to make it work. If you fail, just hit a button and the star will fall anyway.Cheat: MoonwalkIn order to moonwalk, all you need to do it to use Michael's kick attack while walking, and if you continue to go the same direction during and after the attack, instead of walking normally, Michael will moonwalk instead.Cheat: Hear Thriller in the Zombie Stages *REV 00 Only*In any stage where there are zombies (3-1, 3-2, 3-3, and 5-3), if you press and hold the B button then perform Michael's Dance Magic (press and hold A until he dances), instead of the usual tune that plays, a short version of Thriller will play.  Unfortunately, this only works in REV 00 versions of the game.Cheat: Hear Thriller in the Zombie Stages *REV 00 Only*In level 5-2, walk up the pair of steps where you first start off. walk to the right until you see the first opening &amp; closing drop .fall through and hold right to land on the surface under it. after that, open the door and rescue child. Then go all the way to the left where you first were but move to the right side of the box door. wait for the star to come and jump up to get it.                Note: This must be the first child rescued in this level.Cheat: Hear Thriller in the Zombie Stages *REV 00 Only*On stage 2-3 you can also play as the robot. All you do is go up in the elevator at the start of the stage and open the car that has the child on the first floor. After that you  move a little back and wait for the star to come.</plot>
