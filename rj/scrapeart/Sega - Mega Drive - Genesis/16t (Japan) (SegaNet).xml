	<plot>16t is a scrolling platform action game similar to Teddy Boy, in which the player controls a youngster in prison garb named Apple Gaikichi, who must eliminate all the enemies on each stage. Apple's only method of attack is throwing enormous 16 ton weights (thus the title), which can and will crush enemies in a bloody mess. However, these weights will bounce off each other, so the player must be careful to not let Apple get crushed himself. They are also not entirely unlimited, as the player can only hold five at once, and they must be allowed to recharge when Apple runs out. Enemies on each stage will appear from the top of the screen in waves, through a randomly cycling "slots" meter, and once all slots and enemies have been cleared, the player moves on to the next stage.</plot>

	<Notes>16t is a 1991 action game for the Sega Mega Drive by Sega released exclusively on the Sega Game Toshokan service (and on the various compilations that package such games). You play as a computer programmer who goes into his bugged program to debug it by squishing the bugs with 16-ton weights. Levels are a series of platforms that wrap around both horizontally and vertically. A and C jump and B throws a 16-ton weight. You can only throw a certain number of weights at a time; the number is shown at the bottom of the screen. The level ends when you crush all the enemies. Getting crushed or getting hit once causes you to lose a life.</Notes>
