	<plot>Overview:Clue the video game is a very faithful, by the numbers re-imagining of the board game. Players control the usual characters on a journey to solve the murder mystery of Mr. Body. The game uses images, videos, and dialog to help flesh out the cast and add flavor to the players' suggestions and accusations. It also has the advantage of taking care of the confidential case file cards by itself, eliminating the possibility of cheating.</plot>

	<Notes>In addition to play by the original rules, Clue has an additional mode that allows movement via "points." Each turn begins with nine points and every action the player takes costs points. The player can only do as many things as he has points. For example, moving from square to square costs one point, making a suggestion costs three points. Many players prefer this mode of play as it makes the game more balanced since each player gets the same number of "moves" each turn.</Notes>
