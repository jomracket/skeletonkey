	<plot>Roar of the Beast is the second Genesis game based on the Beauty and the Beast animated film, only this time the player does not control Belle but Beast throughout the entire game. It is not a sequel to the first game, as both games were released in the same year. This title largely retells the story from Beast's perspective. It starts with Beast living in a castle in the dark woods with his servants (Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts). A powerful storm hits the castle and enchants all animals around it. Initially the beast needs to protect the magic rose against the creatures. Soon, Belle and her father Maurice become involved, and eventually the villagers who invade the castle.The game takes place in Beast's castle and the surrounding woods. Through side-scrolling platform gameplay Beast can attack from three different stances (crouch, stand up, jump) and unleash a limited amount of roars that stun enemies for a short time. After regular levels, a sequence with a boss follows. There are also a few mini-games where Beast needs to finish a puzzle and catch rosebuds. Certain events are time limited. The game keeps track of the player's score, based on defeated enemies and collected treasures. There is an unlimited amount of continues and the story is told through static, drawn cut-scenes between missions.Cheat: CodesAt the title screen enter the following code:</plot>
