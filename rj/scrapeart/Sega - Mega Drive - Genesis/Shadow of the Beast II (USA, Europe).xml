	<plot>The sequel to 1989's Shadow of the Beast, Shadow of the Beast II is a side-scrolling action game developed by Reflections Interactive and published by Psygnosis in 1990. Although side-scrolling platformers were nothing new at this point, the game was considered revolutionary for its high production values, featuring lush graphics consisting of high-quality backdrops and animations never before seen in videogames, and a stunning, atmospheric soundtrack composed by David Whittaker and Tim Wright. game over sequenceIn particular, the music for SOTB II's game over sequence was of such notable quality that some fans were known to die in-game for the sole purpose of hearing the backing track again. The game, much like its predecessor, is notoriously difficult, and has faced some criticisms of favoring style over substance.Cheat: View CreditsEnter the following code at the Psygnosis Screen....

	<Notes>Shadow of the Beast II finds the hero in half-beast form, wandering the lands of Karamoon in search of his kidnapped sister. She had been taken away from her mother's cottage by the dragon-form of the Beast Mage, Zelek, servant to Maletoth. Along the way, Aarbron befriends the wise dragon Barloom and must defeat the evil dragon Ishran. Tree Pygmies in the forest and the goblins in the Crystal Caverns serve as interactive, complicated foes. For example, a bottle of booze picked up at the Karamoon oasis must be given to the goblin jailer to free Aarbron from his cell. Only after Aarbron gives the old man his ring and his parchment does he obtain a spell powerful enough to harm Zelek.</Notes>
