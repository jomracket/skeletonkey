	<Name>Cyberball (World)</Name>
	<plot>After its time as a hit in the arcades, Cyberball was ported to the home consoles, with the Genesis translation being the closest to its arcade predecessor.In Cyberball, you control a 7 robot football team. The robots are of different sizes and different talents (smaller robots are faster but can take less punishment, for example). As robots are hit, they emit smoke before eventually exploding and fumbling the ball, which makes over-utilization of your best player not the best idea.Rather than downs, the teams must move an explosive ball past the 50-yard line as it goes from cool to warm to hot to critical before exploding and destroying the character who has the ball at that point. The list of available plays is small, with the defense only getting to choose how deep their coverage is and the offense getting a limited selection of pass, run, or option plays.The Japanese Mega Drive version of the game supported the Sega Meganet service for online play.Cheat: Dallas Destroyers Passwords1: LBBB B7CB BDVV 2: LVBB BB9B BDXV 3: LXBB B7LB BD3B 4: LIBB B8FB BDTV 5: LLBB B7DB BDNB 6: LKBB BBBV BDCV 7: LMBB BLCV BD2V 8: LOBB BLPB BFHV 9: LFBB BLHB BD8B 10: LCBB BFOV BDKX 11: L7BB BXGB BDRV 12: L4BB BF2B BDAV 13: LRBB BFVV BDTV 14: LTBB BFCX BD2V 15: L8BB BFJI BDMX 16: LZBB BR2S IDKI Playoff One: LUBB BRHV BDZV Playoff Two: L5BB BXUV BD2VCheat: Dallas Destroyers PasswordsPassword: U2BB GXVG IB7LCheat: Dallas Destroyers PasswordsTo play the last game as the Los Angeles Assassins enter ths password: CGBB B8FB BB2VCheat: Dallas Destroyers PasswordsTo play the last game as the Minnesota Maulers enter this password: P5BB B5PS IHEXCheat: Dallas Destroyers PasswordsAt the passwords screen:Cheat: Dallas Destroyers Passwords2nd Week - UBBB B7VV LFVX 3rd Week - UVBB BXBX LFOX 4th Week - UXBB BFVI LFCS 5th Week - UIBB BXIS OF8I 6th Week - ULBB B5PS OF98 7th Week - UKBB B5PS OFMI 8th Week - UMBB B5PS OFAX 9th Week - UOBB B5PS 9F81 10th Week - UFBB B5PS OFNX 11th Week - UCBB B5PS OFLI 12th Week - U7BB B5PS OFSX 13th Week - U4BB B5PS OFRI 14th Week - URBB B5PS OFHX 15th Week - UTBB B5PS OFFI 16th Week - U8BB B5PS OFB1 17th Week - UZBB B5PS OFDI 18th Week - UUBB B5PS OFII 19th Week - U5BB B5PS OF3XCheat: Dallas Destroyers PasswordsEnter the password: CGBB B8FB BB2VCheat: Dallas Destroyers PasswordsPut in the password: UJBB B5PS OF41</plot>

	<Notes>Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.</Notes>
