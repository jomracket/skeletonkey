	<plot>Overview:The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends is a platformer action game featuring the characters from the long-running animated series The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. In the game, the duo chase after some familiar-looking thieves who rob the Rocky and Bullwinkle Museum on its opening day. The player can also play basic mini-games featuring Dudley Do-Right, the fearless (and hapless) Canadian Mountie, and Sherman and Mister Peabody, a boy and his dog who regularly travel through time.The game was developed by Imagineering Inc. released on multiple systems by THQ. The NES and Game Boy versions were created first in late 1992, followed by the SNES and Genesis versions in mid-1993. The characters in the SNES version actually break the fourth wall to remark on the earlier versions and the similar material, displaying the same wry self-referential humor of the series it's based on.Critical ReceptionWhen the Genesis version was released Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review score of 4 out of 10 writing, "...This is an almost carbon-copy of the NES version, with the poor control intact! Dig the way Rocky attacks with those huge antlers and climbs the side of that mountain! The variety of games is nice, but the whole thing looks rushed".	</plot>
