	<plot>Overview:The main protagonists: John Morris (right) and Eric Lecarde (left)Castlevania: Bloodlines (known in Europe as Castlevania: The New Generation and in Japan as Vampire Killer) is a 2D action horror platformer developed and published by Konami for the Sega Genesis on March 17, 1994.Taking place in 1914, the story follows two indirect blood descendants of the Belmont clan of vampire hunters (John Morris, an American who wields the Vampire Killer whip, and Eric Lecarde, a Spaniard whose love interest was lost to vampirism), as they set out throughout Europe to prevent the resurrection of Count Dracula by his neice, the revived vampire Elizabeth Bartley.Although the game features the Vampire Killer whip, Castlevania: Bloodlines is the first Castlevania game to not include a primary descendent of the Belmont clan as the main protagonist. This is also the first Castlevania game to refer to the Vampire Killer whip by it's name. The game is also known for its attempt to connect the Castlevania franchise to Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula (even by referring to the father of the game's protagonist as Quincy Morris, the name of a key character in the novel).Castlevania: Bloodlines is also known for being the precursor to Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin, in which the player plays as John's son, Jonathan Morris. Eric Lecarde also plays a prominent role in the game.Gameplay:Castlevania: Bloodlines plays like a traditional Castlevania platformer. Players guide either John or Eric through six stages spread throughout Europe, increasing their score by defeating enemies and collecting bags of money (dropped by enemies or destroying scenery). Players will also find jewels (which serve as ammunition for sub-weapons and super "Item Crash" attacks), the "Mirrors of Truth" (which clears the screen of all enemies), black orbs (which grant the player temporary invulnerability), Coat of Arms (which upgrades the player's primary weapon), mutton chops (which restroes some of the player's health), and 1-Up items (which grant the player an extra life). Each stage is linear (with the exception of certain parts that must be completed with a specific character). Along with one boss to close the level, each stage also features one or more mini-bosses.Character DifferencesCastlevania: Bloodlines allows the player to pick one of two playable characters, each with their own unique primary weapon and special attributes.John Morris utilizes the legendary Vampire Killer whip, which can be charged by holding down the attack button. Like Simon Belmont from Super Castlevania IV, John can use his whip to swing from special blocks, allowing him to easily pass certain chasms. Although he can only attack horizontally on the ground, he can whip diagonally and under him while in the air.Eric Lecarde wields the Alcarde Spear, a long spear that allows him to stab at enemies in multiple directions. When jumping out of a crouch, Eric uses his spear to propel himself into the air, allowing him to reach new heights while attacking airborne enemies. Sub-Weapons/Item CrushesAlong the way, John and Eric can pick up sub-weapons that consume jewels for a special attack (which, unlike most early Castlevania games, is given its own attack button).BoomerangBattle AxeSacred WaterCheat: Alternate Music With Final UpgradesEnter the options menu.

	<Notes>In the 19th century Europe's greatest nations had gone to great lengths to maintain a balance of power throughout Europe. The inhabitants sensed that a war would unfold sooner or later and countries formed several alliances, who in turned harbored feelings of distrust against each other. on June 1914 at Sarajevo, the Crown Prince of Austria was assasinated and resulted in a chain reaction of violence across the entire continent. It was said that a strange beautiful woman was involved within the shadows. It was Elizabeth Bartley who had plotted together with the dark sorceress Drolta Tzuentes to unleash an international global war and use the souls of the dead to revive their Lord, Dracula. Two man, descendants of the legendary Belmont family of vampire hunters, named John Morris and Eric Lecarde arose to counter the threat. Together they travled to the ruins of Dracula’s castle were unable to find any trace of the Vampire Lord. After learning that Elizabeth was nearby, they followed in hot pursuit while fighting their way all across Europe. With much effort, John and Eric were able to finally end the menace of Dracula and Elizabeth after a final showdown in Castle Proserpina. Victory would soon be tainted when learned of the terrible price that came with using the whip’s full power.</Notes>
