The turtles decide to enter the tournament in order to stop Shredder and prove their strength in battle.One of the unique features of the SNES version was the different turbo speeds. At the highest setting, this game was faster than Street Fighter II Turbo at the highest setting.Genesis Version Master Splinter is kidnapped by four purple turtles. When the real turtles find out, Krang appears and tells the turtles that he has Splinter with him and that the only way to rescue him is to go to Dimension X and meet Krang. Endings:The endings on the NES version are basically the same for all four of the turtles. The only difference is the portrait of the turtle which the player used to beat the game. In the ending the winning turtle accuses Shredder of being up to one of his lousy tricks. Shredder says that they have not seen the last of him, he then gets up and runs off-screen. Splinter comes floating into the screen, drops down in front of the turtle and says "You have performed well my sons. Now let us celebrate our victory."Endings (SNES)CharacterEnding RaphaelRaphael gives his thanks to Splinter and April by giving them a pile of gifts. Raphael then tells them he is happy to have friends as good as they are. MichelangeloMichelangelo decides to take a vacation in the Bahamas to do some surfing, then invites the other turtles to come along. LeonardoLeonardo says his daily training has paid off, and now he must set new goals and set out to achieve those goals. Leonardo then goes right back into his training.

Chrome DomeChrome Dome now has the money to purchase the necessary computers in order to extract his faulty program. He will finally be able to exist in peace. Critical ReceptionElectronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version review scores of 9,8,9 and 9 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, "This has got to be one of the best fighting games next to Street Fighter 2, (and in some cases better than SF2). The voices are crisp and clear, plus the control is absolutely wonderful! Another factor that I truly like is the story mode set up with dialog boxes unraveling the whole plot! There are plenty of combos that will get you going! Another great hit from the pros at Konami".Cheat: Skip to bosses without losing continuesTo bypass fighting everybody and get to the boss trio without losing continues start a 1P game.  When the screen changes to the space map have controller 2 enter the game for a 2P game.  Have player 2 choose a character and select that person's home planet. Leonardo - Bio Planet Michaelangelo - Mirage Planet Donatello - Futuristic City Planet Rapheal - Magma Ocean Planet April O'Neil - Spaceship Casey Jones - Ice Planet Ray Fillet - Ocean Planet Sisyphus - Jungle Planet You can beat up a defenseless second player and the game will give you credit for defeating that character in the tournament lineup.  After you beat all eight defenseless fighters on their home stages the game will begin with the boss matches and you'll have kept all your continues.</plot>

	<Notes>The game features eight fighters: the four turtles, Casey Jones, April O'Neil, Ray Fillet (from the comics) and the original character Sisphyus. The gameplay is similar to other games in this genre: each character has standard attacks (normal and strong) as well as special attacks which require button combinations to perform. The goal is to deplete the other fighter's life energy completely. However, a losing opponent has one last straw: a very powerful attack which is only unlocked shortly before death. The amount of rounds can be set between one and seven.</Notes>
