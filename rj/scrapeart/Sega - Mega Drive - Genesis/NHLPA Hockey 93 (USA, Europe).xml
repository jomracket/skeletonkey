	<plot>Overview:NHLPA Hockey '93 is an EA Sports hockey game for Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. This game only features an NHL Players Association license: all the players names are present yet none of the actual NHL team names and logos appeared. All of the team's cities and colors however are exact, although the New York Islanders are referred to as Long Island. NHLPA Hockey '93 was the first title to feature Tampa Bay Lightning and Ottawa Senators again though they lacked the team names and logos.The Genesis version also included EEPROM battery saving, which allowed one to save lines and the ongoing playoff, rather than the passwords of the SNES version.The game's ruling towards a number of things such as breaking glass, bleeding and injuries caused controversy among hockey fans. The booklet suggested that injuring top players from the other team "with an extra hard body check" was "part of the game". All these features were removed from following titles, besides injuring.This is the game with the famous wrap-around trick. When shooting downwards, if the player performs a wrap-around starting from the right side of the net, the goalie will get stuck on the far right leaving the goal net wide open.NHLPA Teams and RankingsThere are 26 total teams in NHLPA Hockey '93.
