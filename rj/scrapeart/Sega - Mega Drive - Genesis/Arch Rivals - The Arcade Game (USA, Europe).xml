	<Notes>Arch Rivals is a conversion of the hit Midway arcade game. It's a 2-on-2 basketball game that stands out from the crowd for its "no rules" approach. Fouling out other players is more than accepted, it's encouraged. Choose from twelve different teams and eight players, each with their own traits and personalities.</Notes>
