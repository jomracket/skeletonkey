	<plot>As the titular gymnast "Trampoline Terror", it's up to the player to put a halt to the alien menace who has kidnapped the queen of the planet Ahas. To accomplish this task the player must diffuse bombs by walking over self-destruct switches while avoiding getting hit by enemies. The player can jump on tiles and trampolines in order to distance himself from any incoming enemies, although trampolines can only be jumped on a few times before they rip and become a hole that the player can fall down and die in. The player can also pick up a limited number of P-Balls in each stage and use them to eliminate enemies.Cheat: Debug ModeEnter the following code at the Title screen....

	<Notes>From space, a menacing fortress appears in the sky. Surrounding it, a "trampoline" sidewalk armed with bombs and patrolled by enemy invaders. You, the Trampoline Terror, have the guts to fight back. Stealthful observation reveals self-destruct switches planted on 32 strongholds. Triggering each one will be no simple task. Powerful alien patrols will thwart your efforts, pushing you to the edge... and beyond! And beware the trampolines, whose very structure weakens with your every jump. Only your bounding skill and sharp cunning can save the day. So hop to it!</Notes>
