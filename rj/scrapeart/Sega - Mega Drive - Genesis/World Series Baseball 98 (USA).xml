	<plot>Put yourself into the middle of the pennant race with WORLD SERIES BASEBALL 98. Play as all 20 teams with 700 players thanks to MLB and MLBPA licenses. All of the teams, rosters, and schedules from the 1997 season have been included. A new graphics engine provides the action. All batters and pitchers have stances and wind-ups that correspond to their real world counterparts. As the game progresses, play-by-play commentary will keep you in tune with the action. You won't miss a moment of the action thanks to several new camera angles. WORLD SERIES BASEBALL 98 allows you to play in the majors, but don't expect a Major League salary.http://au.cheats.ign.com/objects/001/001787.html</plot>

	<Notes>World Series Baseball 98 is the fourth Genesis game in the baseball series. This entry has the rosters and stats of the 1997 MLB season (including interleague play) as well as updated statistics for the 1996 season featured in the previous game. Once again all 28 teams are featured. The game types are identical to before: Exhibition, League, Playoffs, Batting Practice, Homerun Derby, and Classic Homerun Derby, along with All-Star games. Trading can be enabled or disabled. The gameplay and visuals are identical to the previous game. A new feature is that statistics are tracked through 27 categories and next to the overall progress in a league for instance, league leaders, team leaders, team statistics and team standings are saved to the cartridge battery.</Notes>
