	<plot>Sansan is a conversion of the popular board game Go, which allows the player to play online against distant opponents though the game's network service. It offers the ability to play against opponents who are not currently online, much like chess-by-mail, and also allows for sending short messages to the other player. Unlike most Meganet titles, it runs through Sansan's independently-run paid service, which has continued to be operational long after Sega's own service was discontinued.</plot>

	<Notes>Sansan (サンサン) is an online service allowing people living in Japan to play the abstract strategy board game Go with other subscribers over the internet on a Windows PC. However, at its launch in 1994, a version for the Sega Mega Drive was also made available. This version of the game allows players who have a Sega Mega Modem to connect over a 33.3kbps or ISDN line to play other members who have a Sansan ID. However, as of 2011, there are no known Mega Drive-compatible Sansan servers. A local two-player version of the game is also included for play. For whatever reason, the Mega Drive version did not last very long — it is one of the rarest and most sought-after Mega Drive games; Sega of Japan's official archive doesn't list it (despite Sansan Co., Ltd. having T-series code T-147) and a ROM was not dumped until February 2011. The Windows PC version of the service continues to this day.</Notes>
