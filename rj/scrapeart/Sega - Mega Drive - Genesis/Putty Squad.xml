	<Plot>Putty Squad is an unreleased Sega Mega Drive game ported from Amiga version by Dynamic Interactive Computer Entertainment and set to be published by Ocean Software in May 1995. Putty Squad is a sequel to Putty, released for the Amiga and SNES in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Putty Squad was extremely close to completion before being cancelled, with the Mega Drive version being reviewed by several magazines of the day (and priced at Â£44.95 in the UK). In the end, only the SNES version of the game was released - planned Amiga (of which the Mega Drive version was apparently based on) and DOS ports were also cancelled late in development. A working prototype of the Mega Drive version was found and dumped in October 2015.</Plot>
