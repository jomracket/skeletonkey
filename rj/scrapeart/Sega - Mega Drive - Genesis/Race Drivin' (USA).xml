	<plot>Overview:Race Drivin' is the first sequel to Hard Drivin', one of the first Arcade racing games to introduce 3D polygonal environments and cars to the genre which had until that point used scaling sprites. Following in the tracks of its predecessor, Race Drivin' continues with the 3D polygon presentation and provides four different vehicles for the player to use. The player can then select between a racing track and two stunt-focused tracks. Race Drivin' debuted in the Arcades and was converted for many home computers and consoles of the era.Race Drivin' was eventually followed up by Hard Drivin' II.</plot>

	<Notes>Race Drivin' is a sequel to the arcade driving simulator Hard Drivin'. Game play is similar to the first game. The player must complete laps around the race track before a timer expires. There are several checkpoints around the track which increase player's time as he passes.</Notes>
