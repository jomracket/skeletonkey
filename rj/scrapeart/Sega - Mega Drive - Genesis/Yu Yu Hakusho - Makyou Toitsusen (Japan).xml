	<plot>Overview:YuYu Hakusho: Makyou Toitsusen (or YuYu Hakusho: Sunset Fighters) is a competitive fighter game for up to four players featuring characters from the YuYu Hakusho anime/manga franchise. It is the tenth game to be based on the franchise, but one of the better considered games due to its innovations and the involvement of Treasure, which developed the game shortly after Dynamite Headdy. It is also one of the harder Treasure games to track down, along with Radiant Silvergun, due to its rarity and exclusivity: the game was never released in Europe or the US, but did have a limited release in Brazil.Despite being a licensed game, great care was put into its mechanics to set it apart from the herd of Street Fighter clones. It borrows Fatal Fury's plane-switching mechanic (which would later appear in future Treasure games like Guardian Heroes) that allows fighters to evade and maneuver around opponents. The game also allows for up to four players simultaneously, with team and free-for-all options.
