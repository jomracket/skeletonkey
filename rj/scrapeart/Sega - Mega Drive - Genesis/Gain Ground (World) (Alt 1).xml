	<plot>Overview:Gain Ground is a top down shooter that focuses on tactics. It was developed and published by Sega, and originally an arcade game before being ported to the Master System, Genesis, and Turbografx-16 CD.The Genesis version has since appeared on several compilations, and has been released on Wii Virtual Console.Gameplay:Players begin with three different characters to choose from, and can gain more by saving them and running to the exit. Each character has a normal shot and a special weapon. The special weapons vary; because of the altitude, range, pattern, and angles they shoot at. The characters also have different speeds they move at.There are a total of fifty levels, split into five rounds, each containing 10 stages; all have a boss at the end. There are two ways to complete a level; players can either kill all the enemies or run each characters to the exit zone, though not all stages have an exit. When a character is hit, they are captured and stay at the spot where it happened. That character can be rescued and taken to the exit, where they will be playable again.PC System RequirementsMinimumOS: Windows&#174; XP or higherGraphics: 32MB or greater graphics cardDirectX&#174;: DirectX&#174; 9.0 or greaterHard Drive: 50MB free disc spaceCheat: Get all charectersAt options menu select hard difficulty then start the game you should have 20 charactersCheat: Get all charectersOn the options screen press A, C, B, C.
