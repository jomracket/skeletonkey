	<Notes>Divine Sealing is an unlicensed Sega Mega Drive video game developed by Studio Fazzy. The game was a vertical scrolling shooter with a sci-fi/fantasy hentai theme: players destroyed enemies and end level bosses in shoot 'em up fashion and would then be treated to scenes where the damsels in distress would be completely stripped of their clothing.</Notes>
