	<plot>Clay Fighter is a 2D fighting game released in which the characters, as the name suggests, are made completely out of clay.  This allows for interesting moves and stylized graphics.  The zany roster includes: Bad Mr. Frosty, a snowman; Taffy, a piece of stretchable candy; Blob, a character who can morph into different shapes; Blue Suede Goo, an Elvis knock-off; Ickybod Clay, a pumpkin-headed ghost; Helga, an opera singer; and Bonker, the crazed clown. Each character also has their own level and individual taunts.Cheat: Play as N. BossPlay through the single player game until you reach the fight against N.Boss. Press Start on the second controller and have that person choose Bad Mr. Frosty as their character. The second player should now be in control of N. Boss.</plot>

	<Notes>Sticks and stones might make him groan, but clay really ticks him off! Bad Mister Frosty is the name, and action is the game. Fists and feet will fly (and other parts) as Frosty and his friends smack it out in head-to-head fighting action.</Notes>
