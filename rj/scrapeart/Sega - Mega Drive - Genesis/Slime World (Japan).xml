No need to pick any mushrooms!  Look carefully at the Computer Map when you start the level.  There are footholds on either side of the top of the shaft.  Work your way to a room just east of the right foothold, and shoot the wall.  Stand at the edge of the ice patch and do a long jump.  It looks like you can't make it across, but if you clear the shaft, you will slide upward and across to the other side.  Now shoot the wall, and suddenly, you're at the exit.</plot>
