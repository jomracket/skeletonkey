	<Name>King of the Monsters (Europe)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:King of the Monsters is a one-on-one fighting game in which two kaiju, or giant monsters, fight each other in various destructible cities. As well as being as the backdrop for their battle, the surrounding buildings can be picked up and used against the opponent and might occasionally contain power-ups and other items. Each of the six playable characters (five for the home ports) inhabits a separate city and has their own moveset. Most of the fighting resembles professional wrestling, with many grapples and throws. The game was created by SNK and was a prominent part of their Neo Geo library, for both its arcade and home console incarnations. It was also ported to various other home systems like the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. Its name is a take on their more famous King of Fighters series. It would eventually be followed up with a sequel, King of the Monsters 2, which instead enhanced three characters from the original game and overhauled the gameplay to be a standard side-scrolling brawler.CharactersGeon - An enormous lizard, clearly inspired by Godzilla.Woo - A giant primate inspired by King Kong.Rocky - A giant Moai/Easter Island head, like the ones in Gradius. Beetle Mania - A colossal beetle that grapples with its mandibles.Astro Guy - A suited superhero, who grows to massive size to fight monsters. Inspired by Ultraman, his name is a take on Osamu Tezuka's robotic hero Astro Boy.Poison Ghost - A green sludge monster possibly inspired by Hedorah. Doesn't appear in the ports.Cheat: Super Run SpeedTo enable super run speed, pause the game and press Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A. Pausing the game again will put it back to normal.</plot>

	<Notes>Players get to choose any one of four monsters for battle, and two players can join forces to fight the monsters together. Battles end when one of the monsters is pinned for a three count or if time expires (in which case the player loses). The game consists of 8 total levels: the player first must defeat all four monsters, with the last monster being oneself, but in a different palette. Then the player must defeat the four monsters again, in the same order, but this time in different cities.</Notes>
