	<Name>HardBall! (USA) (Unl)</Name>
	<plot>Over one million fans can't be wrong. HardBall! is the most fun, the most action-packed and the most realistic baseball simulation ever to step up to the plate. And now with 8-megabits of power, it's in a league by itself. Uncompromising arcade action: Home runs and line drives. Double plays and double steals. Baseball so real, you can almost smell the hotdogs. World Series Championship: Play the best-of-seven fall classic. Save your won-loss record after each contest. Hear the voice of a real National League umpire: 17 year veteran Eddie Montague calls 'em as he sees 'em. Fully-digitized diamond sounds: From the crack of the bat to the roar of the crowd, hear dozens of in-your-ear sounds!Cheat: Passwords(Note: If a code with an 1,l or a I doesn't work, switch them around)   Texas vs. Boston = iAAEIGbe   Boston vs. Chicago = AEECBGcC   Texas vs. Detroit = icB6JaDb   Seattle vs. Toronto = 3cC6JbDE   Cleveland vs. Kansas City = 0cA7IKDa   Minnesota vs. Cleveland = lcB5IKDa   San Diego vs. Montreal = gAAEGEbk   New York vs. New York = FAleBHbf   San Francisco vs. Texas = fclBGiBA   San Diego vs. Cleveland = gcA7HKDg   New York vs. Atlanta = hAAEHFbh   Oakland vs. New York = jcA2FHD2   Pittsburg vs. San Francisco = fAAEFDb3   LA vs. Philadelphia = eAAEECb5   Houston vs. Boston = ccA7EGD6   Milwaukee vs. Detroit = acA7HJD2   New York vs. Cincinnati = dcA2FHD8   Chicago vs. Chicago = 2AAGGAbf   Chicago vs. Atlanta = 2c36Ahbl   California vs. Baltimore = kcB3GIDiCheat: Fat PitchAt any time during a game, substitute your pitcher with another player that is not a pitcher.
