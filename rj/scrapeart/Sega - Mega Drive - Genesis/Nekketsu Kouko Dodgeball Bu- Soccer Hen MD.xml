	<Plot>Nekketsu FC is referred to as a weak team, but now we were finally supposed to play the national tournament. To celebrate the national competition, the team went to eat sushi. However, a series of unfortunate incidents began to happen. Wow, who would have thought the whole team would come down with food poisoning from eating sushi!? At this rate it looked like we would have to give up our dream of entering the nationals, but just then our coach Misako had a bright idea! Of all our sport clubs, dodge ball seems to be the strongest, so why don't we ask them to help us out? The dodge ball team is led by Kunio, and let's hope he lives up to the expectations of Misako!</Plot>
