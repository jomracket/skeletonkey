	<Name>Lethal Enforcers II - Gun Fighters (Europe)</Name>
	<plot>You're a brave sheriff challenged to protect innocent citizens. Powerful weapons like a shotgun, gatling gun, 12-round rifle and even a cannon make your job easier. You'll need all the firepower you can muster in 5 heated stages: the Bank Robbery, Stagecoach Holdup, Saloon Showdown, Train Robbery and The Hideout. Between rounds you'll be treated to the Bous Stages where you can shoot bottles or face-off with some bad hombres in an old-fashioned showdown. Throw out the accuracy scores - the goal here is to survive! If you hit an opponent with a grazing shot, you'll have to shoot again quick to put 'em out of commission before they retaliate. When the dust settles and the tumbleweeds roll by, only the most skilled Gun Fighters will be left standing.</plot>

	<Notes>You are the sheriff of a town set in the old Wild West. Using the control pad or Konami's own Justifier lightgun, you'll be taking out outlaws who are robbing banks and kidnapping innocents. You have the opportunity to upgrade and keep you gun, as long as you don't shoot the people you are trying to save. The action is usually shown on a single screen with enemies "popping out" from various sections. If you do not shoot them in time they will either shoot or throw various weapons at you. You will lose energy if they hit you or you hit an innocent civilian.</Notes>
