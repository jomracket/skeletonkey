	<Name>Tel-Tel Stadium (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Tel-Tel Stadium is a baseball game with generic Japanese teams. The main draw of this particular version is online play through a phone line, but this service has long since been discontinued. Unlike many baseball games, Tel-Tel Stadium takes a rather hands-off approach to the action, allowing the player to give commands to the batter, pitcher, and fielders rather than directly controlling them. In addition to the now-defunct online mode, it can be played single-player offline with an exhibition match, as well as a "pennant mode" where the player builds their own team and plays through a full season. There is also the option to watch a computer-controlled match.</plot>

	<Notes>Tel-Tel Stadium (ＴＥＬ・ＴＥＬスタジアム) is a 1990 baseball game by Sunsoft for the Sega Mega Drive. It features Sega Mega Modem support. The game is a typical baseball game where you are only allowed to control the pitcher and batter — once the ball is hit, you can only watch what the rest of the team does. Pitching is done via a menu of options; swinging the bat is done by hitting A.</Notes>
