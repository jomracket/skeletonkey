	<plot>Paddle Fighter is a digital version of the popular game of air hockey. Two players each control a round paddle, and must attempt to hit a puck into the opposing player's goal, with the winner being the first to seven goals. Each player has a number of special moves available to them, which include defensive moves like blocking the goal for a short period of time, as well as offensive moves like splitting the puck into five "phantom pucks" which can distract the opposing player. There is a single-player mode where a series of increasingly difficult opponents must be defeated, as well as a two-player mode where any of the eight different characters can be played as.</plot>

	<Notes>Paddle Fighter (パドルファイター) is a sports game for the Sega Mega Drive, released exclusively in Japan via the Sega Game Toshokan service. Paddle Fighter is a glorified version of air hockey, with a few special moves allowing you to protect your goal for a few seconds, and lock the puck so that it can be hit in the desired direction.</Notes>
