	<plot>Dashin' Desperdoes was a racing game released in 1993 for the Sega Genesis. Unlike most racing games however the action doesn't take place between multiple cars but rather between two different characters racing on foot. The two main characters have a crush it seems and it's on the same girl, so they decide to race it out. The races take place in a side scrolling fashion, their are also minigames that appear every couple of levels where the characters compete in another not racing event such as seeing who can knock out the most gophers in a limited amount of time. Although the game features a single player mode two controllers are required to play the game, without a second controller plugged in the AI's half of the screen will be obscured, this is probobly a tecnjical problem and not a deliberate design decision.Cheat: Secret GameBefore starting a 2-player game go to the password screen and type ''ROCK'' as the password. You will hear a cowboy say ''Okay!'' and you will go to the rock fall game.Cheat: Secret GameGo to the 2 player password screen and type in UFO to play the UFO minigame</plot>
