Each vessel has its own maneuvering and firing characteristics, plus a unique special power that you can employ when circumstances dictate.The game has two modules: the Melee, in which you can simply blast the computer or another player to smithereens using one of 16 different ships, in either Hierarchy or Alliance fleets; or, should you wish for a more challenging game, lets you play one of 9 preset scenarios.Cheat: Add Precursor relics to any Full Game scenarioIn the Full Game module, select a scenario to play, choose visible or hidden stars, then tap the B button to read through the scenario description.  As the ''ENTERING NEW STAR CLUSTER'' screen appears, immediately press and hold the left arrow on the controller's directional pad (''D-pad'').  Continue to hold the D-pad in the left direction until the star cluster appears, then release it. There will now be Precursor relics at most of the unexplored stars in the cluster.</plot>
