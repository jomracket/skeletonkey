	<Name>Strider Returns - Journey from Darkness (USA)</Name>
	<plot>Strider has been called into action to save the people of the planet Magenta, armed with a Gyro laser and matter converter. He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held.The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.Cheat: Cheat ModeTo access cheat mode, play normally and get a score of 2,000 or more. Then die and get game over. At the high score screen, enter your name as ENIREHTAK and you should hear an explosion sound as confirmation. You will start each level with a full sword.Pause the game and enter the following codes for the desired affect:</plot>
