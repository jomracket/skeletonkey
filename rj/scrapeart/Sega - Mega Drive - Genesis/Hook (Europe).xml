	<Name>Hook (Europe)</Name>
	<plot>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.Cheat: Infinite LivesIn the first stage, proceed to the flying section where you can go through one of two tunnels. In the lower, spike filled one, there is a 3-Up. Grab it and then die. The 3-Up will reappear. Continue as many times as necessary.</plot>

	<Notes>Your blood is pumping and a chill races down your spine! You've finally come face-to-face with the most infamous pirate of them all, Captain Hook, the fiend who's kidnapped your children and sworn never to let them go. As Peter Pan, this is the fight of your life. Everything that came before - your duel with Rufio, your battles against the pirates, even your soaring flights high above Neverland - are nothing compared to this moment. Eleven levels of incredible excitement. Multiple destinations: forests, caves, caverns, towns, lagoons, icy regions, and the Nevertree. Magical items that will give you strength and special powers: apples, leaves, and pixie dust.</Notes>
