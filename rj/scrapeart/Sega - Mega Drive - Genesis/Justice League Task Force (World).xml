Your chosen hero sets out to find information and gather the Justice League, only to be attacked by each hero in their respective locations. Your hero finds out that these are not the true Justice League members, and then goes to find Despero and Cheetah. After they are defeated they lead the hero to Darkseid, who has captured the rest of the team, and he forces them to fight an android replica of themselves. They then face Darkseid himself. After he is defeated, the rest of the League is freed and the military base is restored.		</plot>

	<Notes>The comic-book superhero team of the Justice League consists of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, and Green Arrow. They must defeat the evil Darkseid and his henchmen, Despero and Cheetah. But before they can reach Darkseid, the members of the Justice League must battle each other. You can follow this storyline in Story Mode, or if you prefer to just hold exhibition fights you can choose Battle Mode which allows you to use the villian characters as well.</Notes>
