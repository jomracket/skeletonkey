	<plot>Overview:Madou Monogatari I is, depending on platform, a port or remake of the first chapter of Madou Monogatari 1-2-3. Though Madou Monogatari II is technically the first Madou Monogatari game to be released, as it was featured in Compile's Christmas '89 edition of Disc Station Magazine before the release of 1-2-3, Madou Monogatari I is the only individual chapter to be ported to a platform other than the Game Gear. While the Game Gear release is a scaled-down port of the MSX version with minor changes, the PC-Engine CD version adds even more voice acting; likewise, the Mega Drive version adds several floors to the game's tower and maps each spell to a D-Pad input.		</plot>

	<Notes>Madou Monogatari I or Madoh Monogatari I (魔導物語 I) is a remake of the first part of Compile's Madou Monogatari 1-2-3 trilogy of RPGs released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1996 exclusively in Japan. It is the last officially released Mega Drive game in Japan (with the last first party game, Pepenga Pengo, released a few months earlier), and the only such released in 1996. Out of all the versions of Madou Monogatari 1, this is the most different from the others, with a radically different battle system, new characters, and sidequests — however the story and basic gameplay remain (almost) the same. Arle Nadja is a kindergartener in a magic kindergarten where children learn to become powerful magicians, and she must now complete her final exam by surviving a tower in the kindergarten grounds filled with magic traps that she can overcome by using her magic to gain a better score. But she has a dream about encountering a mysterious person in the tower the night before...</Notes>
