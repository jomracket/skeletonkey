	<Name>Sports Talk Baseball (USA)</Name>
	<plot>Sports Talk Baseball was quite the innovative console sports game of its time, featuring full MLB rosters, and the first play-by-play announcer in any video game.  STB also fully rated every player in several skill categories, as well as including battery-powered memory for season W-L tracking.  While several wonky features did make it into the game (the speach lagged terribly behind play, AI baserunning and attempting to throw runners out had lots of quirks, 10-run slaughter rule), STB was an enjoyable foray into the console baseball genre.Trivia:  The winning team always had a picture of the game MVP in the post-game scoreboard.  It was always the same player for each winning team, no  matter if that person played or how they performed.</plot>

	<Notes>Players can play either exhibition, regular season, all-star, or playoff games. The game also features authentic Major League Baseball rosters for the 1991 season. Gameplay commonly features double and triple plays, and only the fastest runners in the game are capable of stealing bases. It was one of the first video games to feature individual hitting abilities for each pitcher. Classic match-ups include Texas' Nolan Ryan versus Oakland's lineup with such all-stars as Jose Canseco, Rickey Henderson, Dave Henderson, and Mark McGwire.</Notes>
