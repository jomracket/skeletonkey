	<plot>Ninja Burai Densetsu is a Strategy game, developed by Sanritsu and published by Sega,which was released in Japan in 1991.Cheat: Skip LevelsBegin the game, and as soon as you are able to move the cursor, hold Up+A+C+Start. You don't have to press them at the same time, but they all have to be held. It's easier to hold A+C first, and then the rest, that way you won't accidentally end your turn. Now, you probably accidentally opened a menu already, so just press B to get out of the menu, and if you are still holding the buttons, a tune will play and you'll automatically end the stage.Cheat: Skip LevelsAt the title screen, after passing the PUSH START BUTTON option, press C x 29 times. Then hold C + Start.</plot>

	<Notes>Ninja Burai Densetsu (忍者武雷伝説) is a 1991 strategy game by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive released exclusively in Japan. The game plays similarly to other strategy games such as SystemSoft's Daisenryaku games and Sega's own Shining games. You are in control of a team of ninjas fighting another team. C selects a ninja/confirms an action. B cancels an action, or if no action is in progress, selects the next ninja. A opens the battle menu, which allows you to end your turn. Battles are fully automatic. Unique to Ninja Burai Densetsu are side-scrolling special stages: should you move a ninja onto a special space, they will go into a town where they can get various helpful items from townsfolk.</Notes>
