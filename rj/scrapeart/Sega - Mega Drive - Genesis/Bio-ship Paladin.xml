	<Plot>Taking place on the planet Atlantal, a huge battleship and space fleet suddenly appears and attacks Atlantal's largest city, Delila, leaving the city in ruin. The fleet, known only as The Aggressors, continue to spread throughout the planet and further into the galaxy, past the Galegino Path, the sea of flame. To drive out and stop The Aggressors, the best twin-seat space fighter on the planet - the Paladin - is sent out; a powerful bio-ship that can grow larger in strength and size. The Aggressors are suggested to have come from Earth as the enemies and bosses all have vehicle names of different languages and many of the bosses are actually named after alcoholic drinks.
