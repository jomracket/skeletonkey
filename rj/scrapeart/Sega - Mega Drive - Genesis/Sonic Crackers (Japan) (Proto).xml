	<Name>Sonic Crackers (Japan) (Proto)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Sonic Crackers (or Sonic Studium) is essentially an incomplete technical demo showcasing the concept of switching game engines on the fly by using code written into the RAM. It features two types of playable levels, and two navigation type levels. The actual gameplay consists of Sonic and his sidekick Tails working together to clear the stages while being chained together by a pair of rings, focusing on the new dynamic of controlling both characters at once and manipulating inertia in order to advance through certain areas. The stages themselves are largely incomplete, and after the first playthroughs beging looping via pallete swaps, and slight changes to the musical score. Despite its very early state, the majority of the concepts put forth in Sonic Crackers were eventually realized in the later game Knuckles' Chaotix.Name OriginBecause Sonic Crackers has never been officially recognized or released by Sega, the origin of the name was instead taken from the ROM itself. This name was Sonic Studium, which is the title given by the ROM header. The name Sonic Crackers was a nickname given to the ROM when it was leaked sometime after its creation date of April 1st, 1994. Because of this, Sonic Crackers and Sonic Studium are used interchangeably to describe the incomplete ROM. Sonic Crackers is also sometimes called Sonic the Hedgehog 4, due to its unreleased and unannounced state, however Sonic Crackers was most likely never meant to be a sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog 3 or Sonic &amp; Knuckles, based off of the fact that it ultilizes sprites from the original Sonic the Hedgehog and shares many levels, concepts and aspects of the later Sega 32X game, Knuckles' Chaotix.</plot>

	<Notes>Sonic Crackers is an early prototype build of the game Knuckles' Chaotix, incorporating many of the elements that would appear in the final game. Its name comes from a peculiar, and clearly quickly made, ASCII-art title screen. Sonic Crackers is thought to be an engine test, composed of various different game engines, which are swapped out using RAM coding. The game features Sonic and Tails, who, in the main demonstration of its link to Knuckles' Chaotix, are held together by rings that they carry and that are joined by an elastic force. Also, Sonic can pick up Tails and throw him upwards, to make it easier to reach higher platforms. The stages and music are also similar to those in Chaotix. There are no sound effects at all during gameplay. There are no badniks to be found, however there are spikes, and you lose rings when hitting them (even though you have none).</Notes>
