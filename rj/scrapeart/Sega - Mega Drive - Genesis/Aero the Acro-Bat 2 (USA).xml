	<plot>Overview:Aero the Acro-Bat 2 is a SNES-exclusive mascot platformer from Iguana Entertainment and SunSoft, and the sequel to the original Aero the Acro-Bat. The story involves Ektor narrowly surviving his climactic battle with Aero in the previous game, getting saved by his henchman Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, while Aero accidentally falls into a magician's box and is teleported to an unknown location.As with the previous game, the platforming is built around Aero's ability to "drill" through the air. This works as both a means to attack enemies and as a double jump to get around obstacles, though the distance and direction is fixed: Aero can only fly at a 60 degree angle up or down (dependent on whether or not the player is holding down on the D-pad). Levels also have a number of secret areas and power-ups to find, often behind fake walls. Aero the Acro-Bat 2 also includes snowboarding levels.The credits of Aero the Acro-Bat 2 features a dedication to Ayrton Senna, the Formula One racer who passed away in the May of 1994.			</plot>
