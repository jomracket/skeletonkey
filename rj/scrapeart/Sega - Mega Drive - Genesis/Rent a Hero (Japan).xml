	<Notes>Taro Yamada lives in the town of Corja in Japan with his mother, eccentric father and younger sister Alyssa; the family moved there after his father changed jobs. He received his Combat Armor by accident during their house-warming party, when he ordered pizza from 'Sensational Cafeteria' and instead received the suit. After realizing the suit gave him incredible strength and that he is required to pay for the armor, Taro decides to become Rent a Hero, a hero for hire, performing various heroic tasks and odd-jobs for the townspeople of Corja.</Notes>
