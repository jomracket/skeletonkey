	<Notes>This is not your ordinary cup! It's the Stanley Cup! And only the victors of the grueling NHL season earn the right to have their name engraved on it. That's a whole season of blistering slap shots, board checks, hot rookies and mid-season trades. NHL '95 drops you into the opening face-off staring down the line at 84 relentless games - trying to carve your name on that Cup!</Notes>
