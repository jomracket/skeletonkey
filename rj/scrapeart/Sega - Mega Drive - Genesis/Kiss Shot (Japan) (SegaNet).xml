	<plot>Kiss Shot is a simple pool game for one to four players. It uses an overhead viewpoint and shot system very similar to Data East's Side Pocket, and features a standard nine ball mode for one or two players, as well as a ten ball game called "Boulard" which incorporates elements of bowling into the rules and allows for up to four players. On each shot, the player can set the direction, hit point, hit angle, and shot power.</plot>
