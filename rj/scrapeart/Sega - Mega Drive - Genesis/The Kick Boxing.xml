	<Plot>The game is a 1 on 1 fighting simulation.  At first it's impossible to beat anyone so you musty train and beef-up your character (who you can name by the way) in order for him to gain skills that can be used to take out the opposition.  It's these training sessions that actually drag the game down since they all consist of a 30 second spar, kicking a sand back then a reflex test.  These training sessions never change and are always in that order.</Plot>
