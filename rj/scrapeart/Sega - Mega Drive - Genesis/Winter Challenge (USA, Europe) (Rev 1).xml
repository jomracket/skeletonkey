	<plot>Winter Challenge is a video game that portrays seven winter sports that are competed in during the Winter Olympics. This game however was not endorsed by the International Olympic Committee, the United States Olympic Committee, or any similar organization for any other country. It was released for the Mega Drive/Genesis.Gameplay::Most of the games consisted of using the directional pad for steering, and the A, B, and C buttons for performing certain functions like shooting, running, braking, or pushing off, as you would for the ski jump. Button mashing was necessary as times for a couple of the events, but most were focused on timing and accuracy. The ski jump was scored by distance, and the biathlon was scored by time and shooting accuracy. All the other events were scored by time.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Challenge</plot>

	<Notes>An Olympiad game simulating common winter game competitions - the Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge, 2-men Bobsled, Ski Jump, Cross Country, Biathlon and Speed Skating. The game features a basic 3D engine which allows to simulate slopes with ease, which enhances the gameplay of some events such as the Downhill. Gameplay, as expected from a Winter sports game, relies on finding the faster trajectories in most events (Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge and Bobsled), pacing the run correctly (Cross Country and Biathlon), skill and timing (Ski Jump), with button mashing reserved for just one (speed skating). The player (up to ten) can select his (or her) competitor face and nationality from one of 16 possible choices, and by selecting different difficulty settings, different computer controlled athletes take part in the competition along the player.</Notes>
