	<Name>Tecmo Super Baseball (USA)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Tecmo Super Baseball is a 1994 Super Nintendo and Genesis baseball game and part of Tecmo's "Super" series of sports games. The game is licensed by the MLBPA but not the MLB, so it contains the names and likenesses of all the athletes active in the MLB at the time but not the team names. Instead, the game uses generic city names for its teams, as well as featuring two All-Star teams.The batting/pitching uses the genre's standard camera angle of having the pitcher at the top of the screen with the batter at the bottom, but the game uses an unusual perspective for its fielding, which follows the ball rather than switching to an overhead view. The player automatically switches to the closest fielder in the ball's trajectory, allowing the player to quickly reach it and return it. The camera will continue to follow the ball as it is thrown around.</plot>

	<Notes>It has 700 authentic MLBPA players including Ken Griffey Jr., Tony Gwynn and Barry Bonds to name a few. However, it does not feature an MLB license, so the cities nicknames and logos have been omitted, but all 28 teams with 1993 stats are still included.</Notes>
