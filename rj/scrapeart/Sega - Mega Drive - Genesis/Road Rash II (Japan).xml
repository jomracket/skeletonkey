	<plot>Road Rash II is a motorcycle-racing video game developed and published by Electronic Arts. Players participate in violent, illegal street races to win championships and earn money, which is used to repair your motorcycle, pay bail, or buy new motorcycles. The game was released on July 22, 1993.Gameplay:The gameplay in Road Rash II is presented in a third-person view, with the camera directly behind the player. The objective of the game is to beat other racers to the finish line and avoid both obstacles and police officers. The player starts off with just their fists for protection, but other racers may have weapons at their disposal, which may then be stolen by the player. Getting hit by weapons or crashing into obstacles will have your health bar deplete. When you run out of health, your motorcycle breaks down and the race is over. If you crash or if you stop completely while a police officer is chasing you, you will be arrested and taken to the police station, where you will be charged a fee before being released. If you run out of money to repair your bike or pay your police fee, the game is over.Cheat CodesVarious Level and Final Level PasswordsEnter the following passwords at the Password Screen in the Options menu.

	<Notes>Road Rashing isn't just a sport. It's an attitude! Road Rash II is the ultimate 2-player racing game with a radically unique split-screen for distinguishing between racers. Cruising cross-country was never this hairy! Spectacular new body-torquing wipe outs! More obstacles to crash into than ever before. Terrorize your opponents on 5 new tracks, each with 5 different levels. Swing a steel chain for some real heavy metal damage! 15 brand new, lightning-fast cycles, including nitro-equipped Super-Bikes!</Notes>
