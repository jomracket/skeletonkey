	<plot>Overview:Last Battle is a Genesis brawler released in 1989 in the US, Japan and in 1990 for Europe. It is similar to Sega's earlier Altered Beast, in that the game is on a single plane (rather than the z-axis depth of movement increasingly common to brawlers of the era) and the protagonist can grow increasingly stronger, losing his shirt and hulking out in the process. It also features branching paths, the occasional boss fight and trap-filled mazes that rely on the player's limited platforming ability (akin to the temple area of Double Dragon).The Japanese title is Hokuto no Ken: Shinseiki Ura Kyuusei Aruji Densetsu ("Fist of the North Star: New Legend of the End of the Century Savior"), a game in the  Fist of the North Star franchise. The localized version of the game dropped all the licensed elements for its Western release, renaming all the characters, as well as removing the manga/anime's trademark extreme violence.Cheat: ContinueWhen you lose your last life, and the word ''Legend of the Final Hero'' appear, hold A+B+C and then press Start to continue on the stage that you died on.</plot>

	<Notes>Last Battle is a side-scrolling beat 'em up released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1989 by Sega. It was one of the six launch titles for the U.S. Sega Genesis release. The Japanese version, titled Shin Seikimatsu Kyūseishu Densetsu Hokuto no Ken (新世紀末救世主伝説 北斗の拳?, "New Legend of the End-of-Century Savior: Fist of the North Star"), is based on the manga series Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star in English). Since the international version did not retain the Hokuto no Ken license, the graphics and characters' names were altered. It was the second Hokuto no Ken game released by Sega, following the Mark III original (released internationally as Black Belt). Versions for the Commodore 64 and Amiga based upon Last Battle were developed and released by Elite in Europe in 1991.</Notes>
