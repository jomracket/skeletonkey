	<Plot>Lufia &amp; The Fortress of Doom is an RPG for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System developed by Neverland and published by Taito. Following its initial late 1993 release in North America, Taito announced plans for a Sega Mega Drive version, which was ultimately cancelled for unknown reasons. In Japan the SNES game is known as Estpolis Denki, however no evidence suggests a Japanese version of the Mega Drive game was ever planned. The game was shown at CES 1994, with the game receiving a tentative December 1994 release date. This was later pushed back to Spring 1995 (with this delay being advertised as "worth the wait") before being quietly cancelled. It was last seen in a very early state at Winter CES 1995. It is speculated that the game, primarily intended for the North American market, was not released because of Taito America's closure in 1995.</Plot>
