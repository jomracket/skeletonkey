	<Notes>Double Clutch is an overhead racing game similar to Super Off Road. One or two players choose from four different drivers, each with their own special ability, then head out for a race on one of four different tracks. Of course, the goal is to be the first to finish three laps of the course, but watch out for your opponents; bump into them or the terrain and your vehicle will take damage. Take too much damage and it's game over! After each race, winnings can be used to upgrade or repair the vehicle. There are three difficulty levels, which affect how quickly the vehicle takes damage. There is also a practice mode where the player can freely choose any track.</Notes>
