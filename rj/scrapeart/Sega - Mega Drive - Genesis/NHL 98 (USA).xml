Although they could not get the official Nagano Olympic license, they were able to have national teams with corresponding rosters. EA introduced for the first time in their NHL series 3Dfx Glide support which dramatically changed their graphics from previous years (although the SNES and Genesis versions of the game continued to look like the previous 2D games) Game Modes:Exhibition - single game, pick your team and your opponent and face against the computer or friend.Season - You can play all 82 games of the 1997-98 NHL season, trade players, sign free agents and go through the ups and down of a full season.Practice - Try situations like penalty kills, power plays, odd man rushes.

Cheat: Hidden teamsHold A and B and C and Start at the same time at the game menu screen until the team selection menu appears. The EA Sports and THQ Inc. teams may now  selectable.  Cheat: Play with man advantageThis code only works when you play against the computer, and they only have 2 active goalies. First, you must injure the opponents starting goalie. This works best by running into him many times. It would be helpful to turn penalties off, so you don't get called for interference. Once he is injured, score enough goals for the computer to switch goalies. When this happens, one of their defensemen will be the goalie, but he won't be replaced. The game still treats this as even strength, so icing still applies.</plot>

	<Notes>NHL 98 is an ice hockey video game developed by Electronic Arts Canada. It was released on August 31, 1997 and was the successor to NHL 97. It was the last installment of the NHL series to be released on 16-bit consoles or the Sega Saturn. Features[edit] A match in a process between Dallas Stars and Los Angeles Kings. NHL 98 took the NHL series ahead by introducing full national teams, although EA could not get the Nagano Olympic Tournament license due to lack of IIHF license, which Gremlin Interactive acquired. The Olympic hockey license itself was acquired by Midway Home Entertainment. Jim Hughson returns for play-by-play, this time joined by Daryl Reaugh, who provided color commentary. EA Sports also introduces 3Dfx Glide support for the first time in the NHL series. The SNES and the Genesis versions are the final games in the series to be released on 16-bit consoles. Desppite his career ending injury, Vladimir Konstantinov was futured on the game. The Sega Saturn version also has Mario Lemieux in it. He retired at the end of the 1996â€“97 NHL season, yet was still included in the game.</Notes>
