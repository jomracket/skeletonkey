	<plot>Overview:David Crane's Amazing Tennis is a tennis simulation game from Absolute Entertainment and Imagineering for the Genesis and Super Nintendo platforms. Legendary game designer David Crane, creator of Pitfall, lends his name to this trailblazing take on a truly 3D version of tennis in which the camera behind the court and players can move on a z-axis to simulate depth of field, rather than having a fixed bird's eye view of the court as was the standard at the time. The game's realism also demands greater accuracy from the player, with them having to choose the right moment to serve the ball and return volleys.The single-player mode has a selection of fictional seeded tennis players to compete against on grass, clay or hard courts in single matches or in tournaments. There is also a two-player mode available for both console versions. Regardless of how many human players are playing, the serving player is always in the foreground with the receiving player in the far background.</plot>

	<Notes>A tennis game featuring both an exhibition and a tournament mode. In the head to head exhibition mode, the player can choose their opponent (with the higher ranked opponents being better than the lower ranked ones). The tournament mode allows for 16 different players to compete to become the champion. Both of these modes can be played on either grass, hard, or a clay court. The player can also choose whether to be either a left or right handed tennis player.</Notes>
