	<plot>John Madden Football '92 is the third installment in the vast Madden series by Electronic Arts which released for the Sega Genesis in 1991. Among the new features the update brought to the series were instant replay, audibles, quarterback injuries, newer weather conditions, and reviewing and overturning pass interference calls.Gameplay:The game offers 28 teams (plus an All-Madden team) based on city names and team colors from the National Football League at the time, however, due to a lack of an NFL and NFLPA license, team names, player names, and stadium names could not be used inside the game. Modes within the game include Regular Season, Pre-Season, Playoffs, and Sudden Death, with quarters now adjustable to 5, 10, or 15 minutes in length.AmbulanceRest of Field injured by Ambulance from HellOne of the most humorous and controversial events that made its debut in John Madden Football '92 featured an ambulance that would rush onto the field, hitting all players in its sight, much to the delight of the injured quarterback.Cheat: Easy defenseTake control of your fastest defender and line him up directly in between the offense's guard and center, but a hair above where they are standing. If done correctly, you will not be called offsides when the play begins. The line of scrimmage in Madden 92 is parallel to the feet of the offensive lineman as opposed to the ball, which is why you're able to line up so close to the offense in the first place.Cheat: Easy defenseWhen the ball is snapped, you'll usually have plenty of time to blast your defender through the line untouched, and you'll be able to stop virtually every play in the game.</plot>
