	<plot>Putter Golf is a simple, fast-paced miniature golf game for one player. The player's only control over the ball is choosing the direction and power of the shot, and they must get the ball into the cup within par. Each of the 18 holes contains bizarre hazards like bumpers, lava pits, moving walls, and ice. For each stroke over par, the player loses one ball; if all balls are lost, the game is over. However, the player can regain balls by shooting under par.</plot>

	<Notes>Putter Golf (パターゴルフ) is a golf game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive. It was only available in Japan as a download through the Sega Game Toshokan service. Putter Golf is essentially (but whether or not it officially is is unknown) a Mega Drive version of Putt &amp; Putter: a very simple golf game with an isometric perspective. Rather than compete on wide open courts however, the game opts for much smaller levels which would only require a putter (much like minigolf). As well as this, there are a number of obstacles which can get in your way, from bumpers to lava.</Notes>
