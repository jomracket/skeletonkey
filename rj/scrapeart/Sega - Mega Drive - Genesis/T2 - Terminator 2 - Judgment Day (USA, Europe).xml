	<Name>T2 - Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (USA, Europe)</Name>
	<plot>It comes from the future. It can take any shape and survive almost any injury (even when a 10-gauge shotgun blast opens it up like a tin can). Its mission: eliminate John Connor. Its name: the T-1000. Against it stands one hope: you, a terminator model T-800... equipped with on-screen target search displays, a lever-action Winchester, and 10 barrels of high explosives... one mean machine. Protect John Connor (before a 23,000 lb. tow-rig plows your Harley into tomorrow). Save humanity (while Uzi-armed SWAT teams try to blow you away). Terminate the T-1000 (steel mill metldown!)... or mankind is history.Cheat: Skip Current LevelEnter the following code at the Title screen.

	<Notes>This adaptation of the movie is essentially a side-scrolling action game, with both melee combat and shooting; there are also driving sequences between the side-scrolling levels, which mainly consists of avoiding pursuers and safely arriving to the next destination. T-800's default weapon is a pistol, but he can later acquire other weapons such as a shotgun, a mini-gun, etc. The "good terminator" can also use kicks and punches to dispose of the enemies. As in the movie, T-1000 appears frequently and must be fought and incapacitated, but can not be permanently killed until the ending part.</Notes>
