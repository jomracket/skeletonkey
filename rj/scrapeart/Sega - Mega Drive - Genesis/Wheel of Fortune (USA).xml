	<plot>Overview:Wheel of Fortune is an adaptation of Merv Griffin's word puzzle quiz show that allows for up to three human players with a pass-and-play system. Players take it in turn to spin the wheel and guess the Hangman-esque puzzles by revealing letters until the answer becomes clear.The game was released on both the Genesis and Super Nintendo, with almost zero difference between the two versions. It would be followed up (on the SNES only) with Wheel of Fortune: Deluxe Edition, which uses slightly updated graphics.</plot>

	<Notes>A very basic translation of the popular game show Wheel Of Fortune, where you guess letters until you can guess the phrase. This CGA version has three old-school rounds of Wheel of Fortune (where the puzzles are simply "Phrase", "Title", "Person", etc.) and then a bonus round. You can compete against 2 computer players or up to three people can play against each other.</Notes>
