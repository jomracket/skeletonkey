	<plot>The basic Outrun game structure is reused in this, with the main difference being that a futuristic setting has been used. The circuits have some spectacular inclines, and the cars do nearly 700km/h. There are four different track sequences on offer, and your aim is to complete each section of track within the time limit. As in the original OutRun game, near the end of each stage there are forks in the road, allowing you to choose different routes within the track sequences. There are other cars on the road to avoid as well.Cheat: Choose MusicAt the stage select screen, press C + Start to choose the music to play with.Cheat: Choose MusicPress the Start button to get to the title screen that says "Start, Options, and Records.

Now press Start to enter the option menu and you'll have 3 new options: Stage, Mode, and Control.  One of the settings disables some collision detection so you can drive thru other cars, poles, etc without crashing or slowing down.Cheat: Music selectWhen selecting a track, hold the C button as you press Start. You'll be able to choose your music track for the race from any of the main themes. This also works when you are re-trying a track.Cheat: Quick startFor the quickest start, tap the accelerator to keep the power meter in the yellow area. If it is in the red area, you will have a very slow start.</plot>
