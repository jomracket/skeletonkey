	<Name>The Ren & Stimpy Show Presents- Stimpy's Invention</Name>
	<ReleaseDate>1993</ReleaseDate>
	<Plot>In one player the player controls either Ren or Stimpy and the computer controls the other character who will simply follow; however, the player can swap the character they control at almost any time during game play. In two player, players controls one character each, both within the same screen (no split screen). In one or two player several special moves can be performed by both characters standing close and a player pressing certain buttons simultaneously, the move differs depending on which buttons are pressed and whether the player is controlling Ren or Stimpy. The ability of swapping characters during game play in one player means the player can perform all the special moves not just those available for one character. The moves include: Stimpy throwing Ren to cover long distance such as over a hole.</Plot>
