	<plot>License Like so many hockey games of the 16-bit era, Tecmo Super Hockey was released without an NHL license.  It did feature an NHLPA license though, meaning that there were real-life players in the game playing for vaguer, non-infringing representations of their real-life NHL squads.  Gameplay: Tecmo Super Hockey featured a broadcast-angle perspective, making for horizontal puck movement as opposed to the vertical action found in EA's hockey titles.  Tecmo Super Hockey controlled much like other hockey games at the time; it allowed the player to pass, shoot, and check in effort to outscore their CPU or human-controlled opponent.  It also allowed fighting.</plot>

	<Notes>Tecmo Super Hockey features the license from the NHLPA, having the top players of the game at the time. It offers exhibition and regular games as well as playing a season with updated stats and the ability to play in the All-Star game as well. Gameplay is similar to other games, with buttons to pass, shoot, making slap-shots and fake shots, as well as fighting, which is not a common feature. It can be played by two players simultaneously.</Notes>
