	<Plot>Phantasy Star is a 1987 role-playing game developed and published by Sega. It is the first in a long line of Phantasy Star games, and is often considered one of the best games for the Sega Master System. In 1994, Sega released a version for the Sega Mega Drive, Phantasy Star Fukkokuban. This version is merely the Master System version on a Mega Drive cartridge PCB with the appropriate connector pin to signal Master System mode changed accordingly (which is how pass-through devices like the Power Base Converter work). The situation behind this release is unknown; the most prominent rumor is that it was a contest giveaway.</Plot>
