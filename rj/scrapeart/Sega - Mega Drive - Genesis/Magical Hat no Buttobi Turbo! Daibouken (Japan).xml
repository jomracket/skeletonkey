	<plot>Overview:DecapAttack was the basis for a long-running comic series in Sonic the Comic (Fleetway). Written and drawn by comic editor Nigel Kitching, it ran for longer than any other Sega game adaptation (aside from Sonic the Hedgehog). It had a particularly dark sense of humor. Given the limited nature of the game, most of the character's personalities were original including the notion that Dr Frank N. Stein is from Wales and his German accent is entirely fake. Most of the characters' names are obvious puns.Cheat: Round SelectIn Options, move the cursor to Exit.  Now press right, left, left, right, right, right, left, left, A.

	<Notes>Magical Hat no Buttobi Turbo! Daibouken (まじかるハットのぶっとびターボ！大冒険) is a 1990 game for the Sega Mega Drive developed by VIC Tokai and published by Sega to tie into Studio Pierrot's Magical Hat anime series. While this game was never released outside Japan, its story, graphics, level layouts, and music were changed into those of Decap Attack.</Notes>
