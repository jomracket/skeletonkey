	<Name>Super Monaco GP (USA) (En,Ja)</Name>
	<plot>The game was released in arcades in 1989 and for the Sega Mega Drive in 1990 and is an arcade racing game in the style of Formula One.Although the original arcade version of the game consisted of the one circuit, a re-imagination of the Circuit de Monaco, the Sega Mega Drive port has a world championship mode, which consists of 16 race weekends. The 1989 F1 season is used as a basis for circuits and drivers, although the drivers only loosely resemble the real world counterparts.Gameplay:The arcade version of the game was simpler in design than the Mega Drive counterpart, featuring only the one track. The player chooses between automatic or manual transmission and then begins qualifying. The player must qualify in under 45 seconds to progress to the race. In the race mode, the player must stay in front of a certain position in the field. This begins at 20th, but increases as the player reaches checkpoints, finally ending at 3rd place.In the Mega Drive version, The player can fail to qualify and begin the race from the back of the grid.The World championship mode, not featured in the arcade version, gave the goal of winning a season, with points being awarded similar to the real life sport. To add replay value, one the season is over the player goes on to defend the title. In the second season the player is given a seat at the games fictional super team, and is assigned a difficult rival.In this mode, the player drives for team Minarae, and is able to choose another driver as his rival. If the player beats the rival in 2 consecutive race weekends, the rivals team will offer a place to the player. This allows the player to drive for faster cars, and acts as a difficulty curve.If the player wins two championships, the game is considered over.DriversClass ADriver NameDriver TeamReal world DriverReal world Equivalent TeamA.
