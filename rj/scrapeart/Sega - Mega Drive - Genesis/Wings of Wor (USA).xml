	<plot>Wings of  Wor or GYNOUG as it was known in the rest of the world Was a side scrolling shoot em up where the screen scrolled from left to right while you collected various powerups to upgrade your weapons.The game has a very distinct artstyle  compared to other games in the genre opting for a more twisted,  biological look instead of the standard apaceships and aliens, some of the enemies being hige bony creatures with extending necks and various other semi mechanical creatures in the vein of H.R geiger . There were six stages ranging from caves and gothic church-like structures to completely  mechanical and twisted tunnels seemingly inside the body of some creature. The game relies heavily on browns and greys in its colour  palette to create its mood.The character you control is an angel called wor with feathered wings, his weapons are mostly unimpressive but  functional. The three types of shot you are able to use include a concentrated fire, a triangular fire and a dual shot where you would be able to fire both in front and behind.You would be required to fight a mid-level boss and an end of level boss  at the end of all the very tough levels, There were no save points and you would only be allowed to continue from the point you died if lives were remaining. The game despite only having 6 levels is like many japanese shmups and is incredibly tough.there were four difficulty levels, those includedEasy, Medium, Hard and HyperCheat: Easy Mode (Japanese Version)Highlight the ''Game Level'' section on the options screen, then hold A + B + C and press Start.Cheat: Easy Mode (Japanese Version)Highlight the ''Control'' section on the options screen, then hold A for around ten seconds. Cheat: Easy Mode (Japanese Version)Hold Left + A + C when the ''Game Over'' screen appears. Hold the buttons until the continue screen is displayed to continue game play without using any credits.</plot>

	<Notes>Wings of Wor/Gynoug is a horror-themed shoot'em up similar to Thunder Force and other horizontal shooters. But other than most of them where you play a spaceship of some sort, here you play as Wor, a member of the so-called 'Flying men' who look quite similar to angels. The home planet of these people, Iccus, has been taken over by a virus that has mutated into a collection of quite horrible creatures, and every previous attempt to battle them has failed. So now it is Wor's turn to save his home planet and destroy these mutants once and for all!</Notes>
