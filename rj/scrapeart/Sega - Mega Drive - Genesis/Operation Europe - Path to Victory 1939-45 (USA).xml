	<plot>Overview:Operation Europe: Path to Victory 1939-45, or Europa Sensen ("European Front") as it's known in Japan, is a Koei turn-based war strategy game based on conflicts taking place during World War II.The game is the WW2 equivalent to Koei's earlier Nobunaga's Ambition and Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. As with those games, emphasis is placed on individual commanders and their abilities, and the game prioritizes tactics and numbers over graphical prowess. The player has a number of different WW2 commanders to choose from while playing either side, some of which are real but most are fictional.			</plot>

	<Notes>Operation Europe: Path to Victory is a multiplatform war game where one or two players can compete in World War II action. The object of the game is to fulfill any one of the military objectives for either the Axis or the Allied forces. Players engage in modern warfare around Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and North Africa. This game uses abstract numbers and figures in the map view and saves the concrete illustrations of soldiers only when they lock horns on the battlefield or in an urban setting. Urban settings give a traditional 1930s view of housing and office buildings that provide extra protection for units that are guarding them. However, there are massive numbers to crunch and the lack of graphics help enhance the number crunching ability of game's artificial intelligence.</Notes>
