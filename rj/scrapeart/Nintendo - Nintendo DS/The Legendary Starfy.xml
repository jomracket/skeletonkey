	<Plot>The Legendary Starfy is a side-scrolling platformer, and the fifth in the series. Players control the starfish prince, Starfy, as he and Moe explore the ocean looking for Bunston the space rabbit. Starfy can spin to attack enemies, swim, hop out of water, and float through the air. Using these abilities, he can explore levels, find secret treasures and hidden exits that lead to alternate paths on the world map. When he finds Bunston, he can even team up with him to transform into different creatures, such as a fire-breathing monster or a seal.</Plot>
