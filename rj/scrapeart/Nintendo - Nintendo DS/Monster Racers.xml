	<Plot>In Monster Racers, players embark on a quest that will take them around the globe in search of monster breeds to train, nurture and race. Throughout their journeys, players build lasting friendships with new allies, and encounter daunting challenges from a bevy of rival trainers. The real fun comes from capturing wild monsters in their native habitats. As the player progresses, he or she can explore different regions, venture into secret habitats and discover more adventures. The game's race courses are filled with challenging obstacles that test both the players' and monsters' skills in controlling speed, jumping ability, and reaction time. With enough courage, skill and practice, players can make it to the greatest race in the world, the "Super Cup." Using the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection, players can join up to three other trainers to compete in race tournaments or to capture new monsters on safari. [Koei]</Plot>
