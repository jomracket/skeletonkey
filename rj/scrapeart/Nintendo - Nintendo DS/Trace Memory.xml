	<Plot>A pure adventure game for the Nintendo DS platform. You play as teen Ashley. Raised by her aunt Jessica, Ashley believed both of her parents were dead; on the eve of her 14th birthday, she receives a strange letter and a device called a DTS from her father. She and her aunt are summoned to Blood Edward Island, which is where the game begins. Near the beginning of the game, you meet the ghost of a boy who can't remember his past. Over the course of the game, you will uncover the truth of both your own past and this mysterious boy's. Much use is made of the unique features of the DS. You will use the stylus, the microphone, and even the "sleep" feature in addition to more traditional puzzle solutions. Your character cannot die; there are no action or arcade sequences.</Plot>
