Brain Age acts like a treadmill for the mind! Brain Age 2: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day for Nintendo DS is a fun, rewarding game that helps you flex your mental muscles with quick activities that help keep your brain in shape. Brain Age is inspired by the research of Dr. Ryuta Kawashima, a prominent Japanese neuroscientist. His studies evaluated the impact of performing certain reading and mathematic exercises to help stimulate the brain. On your first day of exercise, you will take a series of tests and get a score that determines how old your brain is. This number is called your DS Brain Age. Perform daily exercises just minutes a day over weeks and months to get better at the exercises and lower your DS Brain Age! Why is brain training good for you?  We all know as we grow older our bodies change and it becomes important to regularly exercise to maintain health and fitness. Our brain is no different. That's where Brain Age comes in. How does Brain Age work?  The Nintendo DS Touch Screen lets you write your answers with a stylus, just as though you were writing on paper. Plus, the Nintendo DS's voice input identifies particular words you'll speak during games like the Stroop Test. Brain Age tracks your progression through each exercise with easy-to-read line charts. Use Brain Age each day to open new exercises to test your ability. Brain Age includes a fun calculation competition for friends and family—it's a snap to download this minigame to as many as 15 DS systems using only one Brain Age 2 game card!
