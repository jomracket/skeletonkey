	<Plot>A magical interactive story from the book based on the study of dragons. In this interactive, pocket-sized game, players will explore an interactive journal and adventure across the world whilst discovering, caring for and battling their own dragons. Players will enter a quest for the legendary Longshanks Hammer, an item giving the owner control over all of dragonkind. They will need to help Dragon Expert Dr Drake to find this before it gets into the hands of the evil Silus Copperbone. Using unique interactive book technology, players will explore a fascinating Dragonology journal containing actual information from the books. The adventure will take them across the globe, meeting a variety of characters and discovering new dragons along the way. Their dragonological knowledge will also be tested, being challenged to solve riddles in order to win the trust of wise dragons that will help on their quest. Answering questions wrongly, however will anger the dragons, resulting in a turn-based battle. Players are also able to care for their dragon when it is injured, tired or hungry -- at any point throughout the game.</Plot>
