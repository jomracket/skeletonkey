	<Plot>Eragon for the DS is an over the shoulder action RPG game, unlike the GBA (a traditional RPG) or the PSP (dragon riding only). Take control of Eragon as he works his way through varies events from the book (and movie.) This game uses the touch screen extensively for various gameplay elements such as spell casting and shooting the bow. The game shows the DS's 3D capabilities well with its many environments and the dragon rider minigame. Saphira's mind touch minigame is fun as well.</Plot>
