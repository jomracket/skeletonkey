	<Plot>Living in their black hole of Oog, the Glowbos are a peaceful race who survive on light fed through an assortment of galactic matter, but Oog is under attack and the light is being consumed by the Big Bad Bhobail and the Glowbos face possible extinction. With the help of the Bulboids, the player must manipulate light in order to save a precious race. Throughout 130 challenges, you're tasked with colouring, splitting and bouncing beams of lights to create an illuminated pattern. As well as the standard game, there's also an infinity mode that randomly generates puzzle after puzzle for you to solve.</Plot>
