Randy is determined to bounce back and recapture his former glory, and to smoke out his father’s killer – one of the FBI’s Most Wanted, arch-fiend Feng. Balls of Fury, the hit movie starring Christopher Walken, is now an action-packed ping pong game for the Nintendo DS system! In Balls of Fury, you actually play table tennis using the touch screen. You will need to keep up with the ball as the pace gets faster and the opponents get tougher! There are many fun ways to play Balls of Fury including Exhibition mode, Arcade mode, and Story mode.
