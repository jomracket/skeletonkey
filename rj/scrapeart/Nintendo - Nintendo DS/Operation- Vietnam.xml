	<Plot>Operation Vietnam is a squad based real time strategy game where you control up to four elite soldiers whose helicopter has been shot down right in the middle of the warfare filled jungles of Vietnam. Your mission is the guide them safely out. The game re-introduces gameplay similar to the old Cannon Fodder games where you roam the levels clearing out enemy camps and finding hidden items and power-ups as you uncover the world map to unlock bonus mission. You control the characters with the D-Pad. You can give your squad commands such as stop, follow and engage by using the stylus on the touch screen. You can also change the soldier that is in command either from the touch screen menu or cycle through the soldiers with the shoulder buttons. Steer clear from enemy traps and rescue prisoners of war by taking advantage of each soldier's specialty.</Plot>
