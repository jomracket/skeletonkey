	<Plot>Friendship destroying goes portable! The Kingdom of Dokapon is in peril! Monsters have invaded, and the King has offered his crown and his daughter’s hand in marriage to anyone who can save the land! Prepare to take down your friends or face off against the Nintendo DS in this race to save the Kingdom and win the throne! • Irresistible board game-RPG combination - This board game and RPG fusion will make you think strategy like never before on Nintendo DS! Customization, strategy, and depth are all yours as you squeeze battling, leveling up, conquering towns, and much more into each turn. • Playing dirty is the name of the game - This is all-out, winner-take-all competition, where the system favors those that know how to fight dirty! Jump into someone else's fight, finish off the enemy, and snatch the experience. Mow down your competition and take a reward from their inventory. Use special items to slow down or injure those who get in your way! • Total multiplayer experience - The zany head-to-head-to-head (-to-head) competition of board games is in full force whether you play alone or in a group! Assign control of each character to a human or one of three DS system play styles. Get your friends together, and up to 4 can play in single- or multi-card mode!</Plot>
