	<Name>X-Men Origins- Wolverine</Name>
	<Plot>X-Men Origins: Wolverine is based on the film of the same name and star the eternally-popular Canadian mutant. Like the movie, it covers James Howlett's escape from the Weapon X program that gave him his unbreakable adamantium skeleton and his early history. The story is presented as comic-style stills with text dialogue. It is based on the engine made for Spider-Man: Web of Shadows. The game is divided into six acts. Wolverine must walk through 3D levels and defeat enemies. Attacks build a rage meter. Once it is full, you can active a feral mode. Then, you can attack any enemy on-screen using the stylus. He also can search for hidden scents, which he can follow to find new unlockable combos. As in the comics, Wolverine has a mutant healing factor, so all you need to do to heal is avoid being damaged for a time. There are also a number of hidden costumes to unlock, including some that aren't in the console versions.</Plot>
