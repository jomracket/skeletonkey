	<Plot>Peter Molyneaux's pioneering "God game" gets resurrected and re-imagined for a new generation of handheld strategists in Populous DS. This time players take control of five different deities, and make use of each God's unique elemental miracles to manipulate terrain and encourage the growth of a civilization. Solo gamers can take part in the 50-mission campaign or tackle the "Warrior Hunt" mini-game in the "Free Play Mode," and multiplayer action lets up to four people battle one another using earthquakes, tidal waves, and volcanic eruptions.</Plot>
