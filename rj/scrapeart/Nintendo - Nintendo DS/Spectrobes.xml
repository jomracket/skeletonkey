	<Plot>Junior Nanairo Interplanetary Patrol officers Rallen and Jeena are on a routine mission when they hear a strange distress call. They find the wreckage of an ancient escape pod. Its inhabitant is in cryogenic sleep and when revived tells them about a terrible new threat: the Krawl. The Krawl are an alien lifeform who consume whole planets, and they have already been spotted in this part of the galaxy.  Fortunately, there is a way to defeat them. This requires the help of an extinct lifeform called Spectrobes. Rallen and Jeena must visit planets to find fossils of these Spectrobes, excavate, awaken and train them. There are almost 500 different ones for the player to collect and trade. To excavate a Spectrobe, the player must first locate it using another Spectrobe. Using the stylus on the touch-screen, one can carefully remove layers of rock and soil to dig up the fossil, without damaging it.</Plot>
