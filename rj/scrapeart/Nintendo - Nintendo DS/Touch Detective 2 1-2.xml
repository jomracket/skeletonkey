	<Plot>Mackenzie and the gang return from Touch Detective to solve more mysteries. Although she is now a fully-accredited detective in the Great Detective Society, people still don't take her seriously. A string of thefts will pull her into a puzzling plot in which she'll have to use all her skills to unravel the mystery. Players control Mackenzie in this traditional point-and-click adventure. New to this title is an overarching story linking the five main cases, with an extra bonus case containing 30 side quests, making it a much longer game than the original.</Plot>
