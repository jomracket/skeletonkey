	<Plot>The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest is a 2010 action-adventure video game developed by Headstrong Games for Wii, and TT Fusion for Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. It was published on all platforms by WB Games. The game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film trilogy; The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). Set fifteen years after the War of the Ring, the game features Samwise Gamgee telling his children of the adventures of Aragorn during the conflict; his stories form the majority of the game's content. Aragorn's Quest was the first Lord of the Rings game released by WB Games, who had acquired the rights to make games based on the New Line Cinema film series from Electronic Arts in 2009. The game was aimed primarily at younger players, offering a simplified and less violent version of the plots of the three films. It received mixed to negative reviews, with critics finding the combat repetitive, the narrative too truncated and the overall game too easy.</Plot>
