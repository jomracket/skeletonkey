	<ReleaseDate>2008-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
	<Plot>A perfect re-creation of Bubble Bobble's frantic platforming gameplay, complete with all the secrets and fun that made the original such a classic. Compact levels are spread across the two DS screens, complete with charmingly detailed versions of the series' signature enemies. Rendered in keeping with the original's retro aesthetic, both the level layout and the characters fit the Bubble Bobble style perfectly. Bub and Bob are now joined by newcomer Bubu, as each shoot bubbles in different hues, and can be switched in the blink of an eye with a tap of a shoulder button. A new star bubble has also been introduced which allows the player to change the color of all enemies when burst, with an ability to choose the enemies' color by shooting the star bubble with the player's selected character. Also new is an entirely new method of obtaining a chance to continue once all lives are lost. In addition, several touch screen-based mini-games including bubble-based puzzles and simultaneous three-player platforming make Bubble Bobble Double Shot a must for any DS owner!</Plot>
