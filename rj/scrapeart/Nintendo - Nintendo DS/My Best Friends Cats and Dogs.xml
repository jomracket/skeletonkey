	<Plot>Best Friends – Cats &amp; Dogs: Can this be real? Sure, because this is a pet care game where puppies and kittens can be taken care of and be given a little training as well. If the pet is given optimal food, grooming and heaps of love it will perform well in both agility and beauty competitions. Winning these, the owner will be able to buy even better pet care products for the loved one. Everything – health, looks, mood and performance of the animal – depends on the interaction between player and animal. Detailed and realistic animations of the cute Huskies, Dalmatians, Retrievers, Maine Coons, Siams and European house cats provide extra fun and motivation.</Plot>
