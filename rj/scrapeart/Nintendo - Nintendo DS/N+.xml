	<Plot>N+ is the console and handheld version of the game originally made for systems powering Adobe Flash, N, which was developed by Metanet Software. N+ for Xbox Live Arcade was developed by Slick Entertainment and published by Metanet Software. Unique versions of the game were also ported separately to the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS by developers SilverBirch Studios and Atari.

The handheld versions were released on August 26, 2008.</Plot>
