	<Plot>An accurate re-telling of the timeless 1988 original, New Zealand Story Revolution stars Tiki, a plucky Kiwi bird. The gameplay revolves around Tiki rescuing his kidnapped friends from the clutches of a treacherous leopard seal!! The setting for each of the game's levels remains untouched from the original though the environment's layouts have been remixed and re-jigged to provide fresh new challenges. Graphically, the game has undergone an overhaul that updates New Zealand Story's visuals while retaining the clean lines of its arcade ancestor.</Plot>
