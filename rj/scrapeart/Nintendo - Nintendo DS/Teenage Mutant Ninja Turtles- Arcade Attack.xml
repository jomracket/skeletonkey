	<Plot>Celebrate the 25th anniversary of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in this classic arcade-style game for the DS. This side-scrolling beat-em-up game is a tribute to the coin-op classics that made the Turtles video game legends. The Turtles make their return to the DS to clean up the crime-riddled streets of NYC. Shredder stands poised to take over the city—and only you can rally the might of the ninja brothers to put a stop to the threat in the present and the future... Relive classic Turtles fights in the streets, sewers, and rooftops of New York City. Take on everyone from petty thugs to great masterminds like Dr. Baxter Stockman. The enemies and their weapons are fierce but the Turtle brothers have Master Splinter’s ninja training to survive the latest onslaught. Stop the enemy with your ninja weapons, kicks, and throws. Evil never tires but neither do the Turtles!</Plot>
