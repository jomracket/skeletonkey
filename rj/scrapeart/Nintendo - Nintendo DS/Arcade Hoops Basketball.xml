	<Plot>Everyone’s favorite arcade-style basketball game, now on the Nintendo DSi! ARCADE HOOPS BASKETBALL features your choice of 3 rockin’ soundtracks, state of the art 3D graphics, and thrilling, high-speed gameplay, for the most fun humanly possible in under a minute. See how many baskets you can sink in a fast moving 45 seconds, using only your stylus and, of course, your lightning fast hand-eye coordination. Advanced hoopsters can move on to the progressive level, where a moving basket provides an additional challenge – and the chance to rack up even more points! And for the real PROS, try the 3 POINT CLASSIC MODE, where speed and accuracy are a must as you shoot 'threes' from downtown.</Plot>
