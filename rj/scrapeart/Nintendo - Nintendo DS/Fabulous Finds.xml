	<Name>Fabulous Finds</Name>
	<Plot>An entrepreneur receives an inheritance from a Great Aunt, a house at Carmel, California. The place is in need of reform, so the things found inside are sold in a yard sale to fund the renovation. Fabulous Finds is a hidden object game with elements from other games. The game is divided in three main sections. The first is a hidden object challenge with a time limit, where the player has to search for objects on rooms from the house, to sell them later. Instead of the usual list at the side of the screen with names of required items, the game shows slots to store a general type of object, and the player has to click on things that correspond to the category or theme (for example, "Babies and Kids" for toys, "Yard and Garden" for gardening tools, and so on). Some objects need an extra item to make them work, like power chords and batteries, before they can be collected. Next comes the yard sale, shown in a isometric view, with all the items set on tables and the customers roaming around them. A list at the left side shows clues to what every patron wants ("woman in red wants to cart some rocks"). The player has to drag and drop the customers to their items. The final component is the decoration screen, where the money accumulated on the yard sale is spent on curtains, floor covers, furniture and other things. Clues appear that indicate the necessary items to improve the final rating, that goes up to 5 stars. Sometimes, a mini-game appears where objects have to be collected in the boxes of a storeroom</Plot>
