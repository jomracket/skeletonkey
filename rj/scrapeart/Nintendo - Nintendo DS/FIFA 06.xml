	<Plot>The Nintendo DS version of FIFA Soccer 06 gives players the same great football-playing experience as its home console cousins. This is the first entry in the system's FIFA football series. The games allow FIFA players to select a number of international football teams within a number of licensed football leagues. The DS version's gameplay modes include Kick Off, Career, Challenges, Season and Tournament.
