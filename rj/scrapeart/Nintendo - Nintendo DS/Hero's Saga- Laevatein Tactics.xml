	<Plot>The Story So Far... When a strange girl hands Ernesto, the young prince of Valencia, a mysterious sword and tells him to save his friends, he thinks nothing of using the magical blade to fight off an undead attack. Little does he know that such a small choice will spark a war that will rage across the continent of Yulamecca and beyond... "Hero's Saga Laevatein Tactics really brings back the spirit of SRPGs of old," said Frank "Bo" deWindt II, Project Lead, Aksys Games. "You can definitely see bits and pieces of many SRPGs, like Ogre Battle and Tactics Ogre, lending their influence to help inspire a stellar game."</Plot>
