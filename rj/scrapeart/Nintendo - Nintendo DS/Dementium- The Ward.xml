	<Plot>Once you've checked into this ward, how do you leave? Dementium tells the tale of a man who awakens to find himself alone, with no memories of his past, in a derelict hospital that is frozen in time. Confronted by the deadly, grotesque surgical experiments that wander the halls, a series of challenging puzzles and a cast of peculiar characters, he must face his deepest fears, unlock the mysteries of the hospital, and escape with his life. Dementium: The Ward combines action-adventure, first-person shooter, and survival horror into one nightmarish experience. Pushing the limits of the Nintendo DS with full 3D visuals, Dementium aims to raise the bar for mature handheld games. A completely new experience on the Nintendo DS from new publisher Gamecock Media Group, Dementium will creep you out with gory visuals and bone-chilling audio that brings this eerie ward to screaming life.</Plot>
