	<Plot>LifeSigns is similar to Trauma Center medical games, but focuses more on the story and character development, almost like a soap opera. You play as Dr. Tendo, a second year intern at a hospital, performing surgeries on patients while at the same time balancing relationships with fellow doctors and nurses. The gameplay for the surgery is a more step-by-step-style minigames, performing certain tasks during the surgery for it to be a success, but you also have to examine the patient beforehand to figure out the problem they are suffering from. Between surgeries, you also have to juggle romantic relationships with female doctors and nurses, saying the right things or buying them romantic items in order to succeed. You can also play mini-games like fishing and cooking to relieve stress from the hospital as well.</Plot>
