	<Plot>Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland is an adventure game with a difference. Rather than hacking and slashing your way through hordes of enemies, the player controls Tingle, who must earn money through bartering and by cooking up recipes with ingredients that would be worthless on their own, but become valuable when sold as recipes to the right people. Tingle will encounter scuffles with enemies, which drains his cash - however, the more enemies involved in the fight, the greater the spoils for Tingle when he eventually wins!</Plot>
