	<Name>Dead N Furious</Name>
	<Plot>The player takes on the role of Rob Steiner, a prisoner in the Ashdown Hole State Penitentiary, who wakes one night to find his cell open and a pistol conveniently nearby. He shortly discovers that the prison is now overrun with zombies and his only way out is to shoot his way out. To shoot an enemy, the player taps the stylus on the screen and it is possible to target different body parts. Reloading is done through a clip in the bottom right hand corner, and the D-pad and face buttons are used to switch weapons. Ammo and health is gathered by shooting crates and the levels feature certain forks with different level paths. The available weapons are a handgun, shotgun, submachine gun and crowbar.</Plot>
