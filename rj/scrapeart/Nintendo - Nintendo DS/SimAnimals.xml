	<Plot>In SimAnimals, players can engage with the wild world of animals in their natural surroundings in an immersive and tactile way. In this game you are challenged to engage, touch, move and try to control more than 60 animals as you journey deeper and deeper into the forest. You control an on-screen animated hand that allows you to reach out and touch, pick up and move everything in the game from foxes and bears to trees and flowers. Cohabitate with these animals in their natural surroundings, and based on how you treat them, the animals will come to know and love â€“ or dislike you! Have fun developing relationships with wild animals and their families, and experience the humor and drama of surviving in the wilderness.</Plot>
