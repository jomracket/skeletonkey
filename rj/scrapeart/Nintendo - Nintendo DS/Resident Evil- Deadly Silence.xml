	<Plot>Resident Evil: Deadly Silence is an enhanced version of the original Resident Evil, a survival horror video game developed and released by Capcom originally for the PlayStation in 1996. The game introduces Resident Evil series mainstays Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine as members of an elite task force known as S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service). At the start of the game, players select one of the two as they investigate the disappearance of their fellow team members on the outskirts of Raccoon City, and become trapped in an old mansion infested with zombies and other monsters. As players explore this mysterious place, they uncover clues and solve puzzles. Depending on the player's actions, the game ends with different outcomes. There are many new features added into Deadly Silence, including "Knife Battle" sequences in which the player must stab enemies in the face by swinging the knife via the stylus. The player can also shake off enemies by using touch screen and stab a zombie.</Plot>
