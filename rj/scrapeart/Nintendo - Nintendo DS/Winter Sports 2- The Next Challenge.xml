	<Name>Winter Sports 2- The Next Challenge</Name>
	<Plot>Winter Sports 2009 is the follow-up to Winter Sport 2008. There are two new disciplines: snowboard half-pipe and biathlon. Others include curling, skeleton, bobsleigh, alpine skiing and more.  There is a local multiplayer mode featuring either hot-seat or split screen. Also the game features different weather conditions throughout the disciplines, and a physics engine that adds more realism and a more action-oriented approach compared to previous installments of the series. The difference between the DS and the console versions is that on the DS, there are less disciplines (9 instead of 18). The DS version doesn't feature an online mode or a complex career mode like in the other versions of the game (where all disciplines can be played in a championship), but features a fast mode where players can go through the single disciplines and train their skills, as well as a campaign mode where players compete against the computer in different disciplines. The game is controlled with the stylus and the touchscreen of the DS.</Plot>
