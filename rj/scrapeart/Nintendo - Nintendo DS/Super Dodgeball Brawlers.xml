	<Plot>Super Dodgeball Brawlers, originally released in Japan as Chou Nekketsu Koko Kunio-kun Dodgeball Bu (????? ???????????? Cho Nekketsu Koko Kunio kun Dojjiboru Bu?, "Super Nekketsu High School Kunio Dodgeball Club") is a dodgeball-based sports game released for the Nintendo DS. This game marked the return of Kunio-kun characters in a dodge ball based on the characters owned by Million. It is also the first Kunio-kun game published in a mobile platform where the English-language version uses Japanese character and team names. Previously, only the Neo-Geo Super Dodge Ball game (developed and published by Technos) followed such naming rules. Aksys marketed Super Dodgeball Brawlers under the 'Kunio series.' However, the game does not use any previously available Super Dodge Ball music in all region releases.</Plot>
