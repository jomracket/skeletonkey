Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria are still struggling to get home to New York. This time, their journey takes them to Europe, where they are relentlessly pursued by the murderous Monaco-based French Animal Control officer Captain Chantel Dubois (Frances McDormand). As a means of getting passage to North America, the zoo animals join a circus, where they become close friends with the animal performers, especially Gia (Jessica Chastain), Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) and Stefano (Martin Short). Together, they spectacularly revitalize the business and along the way find themselves reconsidering where their true home really is.
