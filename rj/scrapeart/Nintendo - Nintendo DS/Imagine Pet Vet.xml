	<Name>Imagine Pet Vet</Name>
	<Plot>Your dream has always been to start your own animal clinic, but little did you know that taking care of animals is only a small part of what you need to do to run a successful vet hospital. Not only are you taking care of a large number of animals in Imagine Pet Vet, you’ll need to further your knowledge and gain in medical rank to become a Master Vet. Plus, as your clients grow, your facilities must grow, as well. You’ll need to increase your hospital’s capabilities, make it more comfortable and make sure to turn a profit and be as efficient as possible. Most importantly, you need to be a good doctor. That means you’ll need to diagnose illnesses quickly and then move fast with the cure. On the DS Touch Screen, you’ll use such instruments as a stethoscope, X-ray machine, a microscope, a syringe and more to cure dozens of diseases, set broken bones and rid animals of pests like fleas. Although you’ll need to manage your hospital and hand out cures, you’ll mostly want to make sure you have time to play with the various animals, as well. Happiness, after all, is the best medicine. Use the DS’s wireless function to connect with Pippa Funnell 2: Farm Adventures. You will get a chance to care for the horses sent to you, and new mini-games will be unlocked on your Game Card. You don’t have to go it alone. Family is beside you every step of the way. Grandpa, Grandma and your cousin will help make yours a successful vet clinic. Dress for success by choosing the outfits and the physical aspects you want in your character.</Plot>
