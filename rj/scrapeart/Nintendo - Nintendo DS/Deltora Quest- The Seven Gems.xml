	<Plot>The game features nine main levels (one level is equivalent to one novel in the book series). Apart from the main quest, the game also has five extra zones. They include Tom's Shop (where items can be purchased), Phantom Tower (in which players must fight through hoards of enemies in order to find stairs which lead higher into the tower. As the player progresses in height, the enemies become harder to kill. Every ten levels, a boss is presented to the player), Mokito's House (where players must chase Makito down by answering quiz questions about the video game and facing obstacles), Mix Mix Room (where, by adding ingredients, potions can be crafted) and Grand Farm (in which players meet a farmer called Jack. He gives you the mission of eliminating monsters that are destroying his farm).</Plot>
