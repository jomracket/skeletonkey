	<Plot>This double pack includes two separate racing games, selected from the main menu. ATV: Thunder Ridge Riders Players race using ATVs (All-Terrain Vehicles) in different game modes such as Quick Game, Career Mode or Timed Checkpoint. Multiplayer games are supported as well. The top screen shows the vehicles and on the racing track from a third-person perspective, while the bottom screen contains statistics such as the standings, a timer and a mini-map of the track. Racing is very straightforward: steering, acceleration, boost, brakes and reverse. In the Career mode players need a good result to advance. They can also pick up money icons to upgrade the vehicle in the Mod Shop with new tires, engines, shocks or turbo boosts. Monster Truck Mayhem This game focuses on monster truck racing with game modes such as Quick Game, Career and Multiplayer. There are different trucks to compete at two types of events: Track Races (regular racing) and Crunch Melee (crunch more cars than the competition). The screens are divided just like ATV: Thunder Ridge Riders with similar controls. In the Career mode players need to do well to advance and they use money pick-ups from the races to upgrade the trucks with new engines, stocks, tires, nitro boost and turbo boost.</Plot>
