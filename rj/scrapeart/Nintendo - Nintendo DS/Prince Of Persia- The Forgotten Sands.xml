	<Plot>Along with Wii and PSP releases of the game, Nintendo DS version of Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands also features a unique platform-specific gameplay style and entirely different storyline from the base game. The story in DS version takes place after the Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones and tells the story of our prince being abducted by a cult who uses the prince's royal blood and the power of the sand to free an ancient imprisoned evil in the temple somewhere in India. In the process of sacrifice and resurrection, the prince lost his memories and the queen Razia lost her powers. The two of them soon team up, prince having no reason to doubt her words, even if he himself does not remember anything, and they set off to hunt down the cult members and kill the resurrected master of the cult. The game is a side-scrolling platformer using 3D graphics and a fixed camera and is played entirely by stylus.</Plot>
