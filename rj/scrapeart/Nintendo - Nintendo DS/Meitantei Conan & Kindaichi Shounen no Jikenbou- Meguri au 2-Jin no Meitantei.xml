	<Plot>The game is played similarly to a visual novel, but with investigation aspects and mini-games incorporated. Players are able to visit various locations at a given time and examine the environments they come across. The game is played from the perspectives of both Edogawa Conan and Kindaichi Hajime at differing points. A typical playthrough of the game will last around 40 hours. The game spans seven chapters, with the seventh and final chapter allowing you to choose to play as either character. The final chapter is meant to be played as both characters to fully complete the game as it plays out very differently depending on the character you have chosen.</Plot>
