	<Plot>While Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer takes it's inspiration from the TV special it's actually split into four original stories. You'll have to read these before you do anything but unfortunately there's heaps of text and given the age range this is aimed at, most games will want to skip the story all together. Sadly, this is not possible and you'll be forced to sit through what seems like hours of tedious storytelling in order to unlock the various min-games. Once available these mini-games sit in the 'activities' section and are definitely the 'highlight' of the whole package with some games, which actually manage to embrace the whole Christmas Season such as making snowmen and decorating trees. There're also old favorites such as Word Find (Word Search), Jigsaw Puzzles, Paint By Numbers, Pairs and Dot-to-Dot but astonishingly there's still a few awful 'fillers' such as the 'racing' event. While Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer comes from the same developers as Santa Claus is Comin' to Town it's actually a little better although that wouldn't be too difficult. It's still all designed for the younger gamer in mind and they'll still be forced to sit though an agonising amount of text but at least the pay off here is some rather entertaining Festive Games. We'd still advise not paying anywhere near to full price for the opportunity to actually own this cart but if you do happen to see it (very) cheap it's probably worth a look. Anyone looking for a true 'Festive Fix' should try and route out a copy of Santa Jr., a classic DS platformer which was released some years ago.
