	<Name>Tsumiki- Block Drop Mania</Name>
	<ReleaseDate>2011-10-21T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
	<Plot>Pile up blocks that fall from the sky until you reach the 'zone ceiling' target. Once a block touches the ground or another block, it will stick and the next block will start to fall. If a block comes to rest in a position that isn't well-balanced, it could topple off. You can grab hold of falling blocks using the stylus and slide them around or rotate them by manipulating their centers of gravity. The key to building a good stack is landing blocks in a stable, well-balanced position. Features • Stack piles of colorful shapes without dropping them. • Use realistic physics and gravity to keep the pieces from falling.</Plot>
