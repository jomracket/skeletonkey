	<Plot>Ed, Edd n Eddy: Scam of the Century is an action video game developed by Art Co., Ltd and Cartoon Network Interactive, and published by D3 Publisher and WB Games for the Nintendo DS handheld console. The game is based on the popular, long-running Cartoon Network animated television series, Ed, Edd n Eddy. It was released on October 23, 2007, in the United States.
