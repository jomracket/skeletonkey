	<Plot>In Yogi Bear: The Video Game, help Yogi Bear (voiced by Dan Akroyd, who also stars as Yogi in the movie) save Jellystone Park from being shut down forever. Players will be able to explore, jump, crawl, belly slide, sneak, and zip-line through majestic Jellystone Park locales in search of wildlife, adventure, and sometimes the distraction of a pic-a-nic basket or two! However, be careful, Ranger Smith doesn't tolerate disturbance of his campers and keeps a watchful eye over the park. Luckily there is Yogi Bear's trusty sidekick Boo Boo, to help Yogi get through difficult challenges and antics.</Plot>
