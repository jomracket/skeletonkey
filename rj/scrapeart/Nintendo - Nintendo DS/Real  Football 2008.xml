	<Plot>Real Football 2008 is a sport game about soccer. Basically, the title aims to win interest of both novices and veterans of the genre, who look for more advanced solutions. Real Football series was originated on mobile phones and achieved a significant success (over 4 million copies sold). This title is the first one released on Nintendo DS. The production offers a rather standard selection of game modes. You can play a quick match or choose from more complex modes. There is also something for multiplayer lovers - you can play matches with up to 10 people playing together. What is worth noting, apart from easy-to-learn controls, AI of the opponents adjusts to your preferred playstyle. Main actions are performed using D-pad and standard buttons. However, some actions, e.g. penalties, are done with the console’s touchscreen. This is also used for selecting options or marking players on the pitch. Another interesting thing is the use of the handheld’s microphone. This lets you e.g. argue with a referee during a match. Real Football 2008 sports high quality level visuals. Stadiums, where matches are played, were created with much fidelity, and character models are in full 3D.</Plot>
