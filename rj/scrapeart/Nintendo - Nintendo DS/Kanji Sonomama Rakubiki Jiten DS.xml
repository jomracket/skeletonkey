	<Plot>Kanji Sonomama DS Rakubiki Jiten ("Kanji As-it-is DS Fun-to-use Dictionary") is, as can be guessed from the name, a kanji dictionary for the Nintendo DS. It provides definitions for Japanese and English words in Japanese, using an intuitive hand-written interface for word look-up. There is a flashcard mode where a user can practice their kanji, and it also interfaces with Pictochat for use of the dictionary during conversations. As a bonus, there are also several recreations of Nintendo's Game &amp; Watch games present, which can be found and played by entering their names into the dictionary. Included are Ball (ボール), Flagman (フラッグマン), Judge (ジャッジ), and Manhole (マンホール).</Plot>
