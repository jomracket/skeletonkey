	<Plot>Princess Natasha: Student, Secret Agent, Princess Natasha is a Zoravian princess and the only daughter of King Carl and Queen Lena. She's also a secret agent! She's been sent to Illinois to stop her evil Uncle Lubek from stealing the Zoravian throne. She pretends to be just an ordinary exchange student and can't tell any of her friends that she's actually a princess. That would spoil the whole 'secret' agent thing-like they'd believe her anyway!</Plot>
