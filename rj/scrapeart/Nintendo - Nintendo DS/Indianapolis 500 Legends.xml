	<Plot>Indianapolis 500 Legends is a racing game recounting the history of the Indianapolis 500. Players take on the roles of various famous racers between 1961 and 1971, completing tasks such as overtaking a specified number of cars or qualifying under a set time. Some missions will change the course of history, such as guiding Parnelli Jones to victory in 1967 when historically, in the 197th lap, a faulty bearing ground his car to a halt. The option will also be given to race the full 200 laps.[3] Players are also able to unlock three different '500' racers as they complete their missions under Mission Mode. Some of the missions are: 'epic', 'pit stop', 'race', 'battle', 'qualify', 'dodge' and 'pass'.</Plot>
