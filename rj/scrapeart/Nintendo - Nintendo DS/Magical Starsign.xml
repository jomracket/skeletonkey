	<Plot>The students of Will O'Wisp magical academy have a little problem: Their teacher has mysteriously disappeared. After commandeering a handful of rockets to rescue her, they've wound up on a strange (and sometimes scary) adventure through outer space. Now players must rescue both their classmates AND their teacher - and just maybe the whole solar system while they're at it. Explore strange planets. Players see the sights of this strange, sci-fi fantasy setting as they uncover the secret behind their teacher's disappearance in this epic role-playing game. The stylus controls everything, from combat to conversations to outfitting allies. Simple controls make it easy to play but a challenge to master. Players can link up wirelessly with five friends and explore the amigo dungeon together - they'll find unending challenges and incredible rewards as they delve into the depths of this unique multiplayer experience.</Plot>
