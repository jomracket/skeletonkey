	<Plot>Monster Lab is a video game for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS that was developed by Backbone Entertainment's Vancouver, British Columbia-based studio and published by Eidos. Debuting at the 2006 Comic-Con International convention in comic book form as Mad Science Alliance, the game is described as "Pok√©mon meets Tim Burton". The player controls a scientist and is helped by three professors to build his own monster. There are 150 parts to build a monster (which effect the monster's strengths and weaknesses), and 300 items. The Wii version features Wi-Fi online modes. In addition to turn-based combat, extensive use is made of the DS stylus and Wii Remote in monster-building minigames.</Plot>
