	<Plot>Toy Story 3: The Video Game is a platform video game loosely based on the film Toy Story 3. It was published by Disney Interactive Studios (which is the developer for iOS) and developed by Avalanche Software (PS3, Wii, Xbox 360, PC, Mac OS X), Asobo Studio (PS2, PSP) and n-Space (DS). The game was released in North America on June 15, 2010, for the iOS, Nintendo DS, Wii, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and the Xbox 360. A special PlayStation 2 bundle with Toy Story 3: The Video Game was released on October 31, 2010, followed by the game's individual release on November 2, 2010.[1][2] It's the only video game based on the Toy Story franchise to be released for the PlayStation 2, as well as the last video game based on a Disney and/or Pixar product on the console. Toy Story 3 is the first game based on a film by Pixar to be published entirely by Disney Interactive Studios. Past Disney/Pixar movie games have been made in conjunction with Activision first, then THQ.[3] It is the sequel to the second game that was based on the second film in the franchise. Most of the voice cast from the film returned to reprise their characters in the game with the exception of Tom Hanks (Woody) and Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear). Jim Hanks returned to voice Woody from the Toy Story 2 game, and Mike MacRae voiced Buzz. The game also contains content exclusive to the PlayStation 3 version that allows the player(s) to turn into Zurg in Woody's Round up.[4] The game was well received by critics and was a top-seller in the UK.</Plot>
