	<Name>Reflect Missile</Name>
	<Plot>Reflect Missile's name basically says it all. You must fire off missiles in order to destroy certain blocks, which can be achieved by having them reflect off walls. But "Reflector" missiles are actually just one of three types of missiles you can use - the "Driller" missile is able to drill straight through up to seven blocks before disappearing, while the "Bomber" missile will explode on contact with anything, taking out all blocks within a certain radius. Obviously, neither of these two missiles will bounce off walls like the Reflector, meaning you should try to clear a path for them first if you need to.</Plot>
