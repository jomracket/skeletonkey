	<Plot>Bub and Bob break onto the DS! Bust-a-Move DS brings bubble-bursting puzzle fun to the Nintendo DS. Bub and Bob return to center stage as they fling bubbles from the bottom screen to the top in an attempt to match three bubbles causing them to pop. In Bust-A-Move DS, players fling bubbles from the bottom screen to the top in an attempt to match three bubbles and cause them to pop before their allotted time is up. Bust-A-Move DS is the ultimate party game that allows up to five gamers to compete simultaneously via the Nintendo DS wireless LAN capabilities. You have to be fast because with each second you waste deciding your next move, the rows of bubbles get lower and lower. • More than 250 puzzles to complete plus tons of secret puzzles to unlock. • Strategically use special bubbles like Bomb, Star, Rainbow and the grief-causing Nuisance bubble. • Compete in multiplayer tournaments via wireless link with up to five people. • Perform attacks, defense moves and counter attacks during multiplayer action via the touch screen. • Stock special bubbles and save them for the right moment to get the maximum points. • Pull back Bub and Bob’s slingshot with the Nintendo DS stylus to control where your bubbles hit.</Plot>
