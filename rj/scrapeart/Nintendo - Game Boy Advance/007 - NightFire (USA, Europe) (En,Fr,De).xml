The story follows James Bond as he tries to thwart the plan of Raphael Drake, a green industrialist whose ulterior motives are to take over the world. Founder of the Phoenix International Corporation, Drake has been entrusted with dismantling warheads throughout the world. Although his efforts are purportedly philanthropic, Intelligence suspects that Drake is organizing the theft of a secret component of the missile guidance hardware intended for the U.S. Space Weapons Platform. With the help from Q and other key agents, James Bond must travel to exotic locales, including under water and to space, in order to stop Drake before he succeeds in taking over the world.Although Pierce Brosnan appears on the cover of the game, and the James Bond model bears his likeness, Bond is actually voiced by Maxwell Caulfield, whose vocal performance is not based on Brosnan.AlliesZoe Nightshade - An old ally and rising CIA field agent.

James Bond must fight his way through various types of enemies using a variety of weapons and gadgets.
