	<plot>Critical ReceptionGame Informer issued the review scores of 7 and 8.5. Jay, who awarded the higher score, wrote, "...it kicks ass. This is largely due to its fluid controls. All the important functions, other than gas and steering, are on the shoulder button, and races are won and lost based upon your proficiency with these maneuvers...The career mode is set up perfectly, and bonuses like freestyle and stunts only add to an already immaculate package".Kato, however, wrote, "...collision detection with other riders, objects, and the ground could be tightened, although there are some great dust/ dirt effects".Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 7.0, 7.5 and 7.5 out of ten. Greg Sewart, who gave the game 7.5, wrote, "...It's not the prettiest game, the music is far too repetitive, and the bike's engine still doesn't sound like it's reacting correctly to the throttle. But on the up side we have an excellent create-a-biker mode, some wonderful tutorials, and some surprisingly good control. In fact, I'd hazard to say that I like the jumping physics of MX2002 just as much as ATV's...".</plot>
