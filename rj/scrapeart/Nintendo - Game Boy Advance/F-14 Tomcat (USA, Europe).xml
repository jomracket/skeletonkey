	<Name>F-14 Tomcat (USA, Europe)</Name>
	<plot>One of the Game Boy Advance's launch titles from Majesco (alongside Boxing Fever and Iridion 3D), F-14 Tomcat is essentially a port of Absolute Entertainment's 1994 SNES game Turn and Burn: No-Fly Zone. The game content is exactly the same, but it features a multiplayer mode between other systems (if they have a copy of the game and the GBA Link Cable, of course) and a brand new storyline: the player controls a F-14 pilot chosen by the US government to be assigned in the theater of operations of a war between the republics of China and Taiwan to protect America's "interests" in the region.The game includes, apart from the previously mentioned multiplayer mode, a landing practice mode, like Turn and Burn. It was later implemented in Majesco's two following GBA flight sims, 2004's Super Hornet F/A-18F and 2007's F24 Stealth Fighter, which re-used this game's engine, with the option of selecting between a landing carrier or a landing strip.Cheat: Level PasswordsLevel/Novice/Ace  -------------------- 2/ DHGJ KLFF/XDFT RLFF  3/ GSDF BFPT/KJTR DBPT  4/ RRHC FDVM/RVBP ZJVM  5/ BPSX FDNF/BMNQ YLNF  6/ LDFS DTKQ/LFMS DNBQ  7/ PXSB SZNJ/PGHP CZNJ  8/ DKXZ GZQK/DKDG BPQK  9/ GKQB GHCT/GSYP ZLCT  10/DTRH RPFJ/DCZX RPQR  11/WZPK JYZX/WRTN JYSX  12/JDZF LKFV/JDPQ MLRT  13/SPNG DRRG/SPBX BMRG  14/SFGF JHDH/SPXP RGDH  15/LPFH PRFZ/LPFG NBGZ  16/TDKZ XSHX/TQWJ GZHN  17/DGBV KMNB/BGJK SZPQ  18/KJHG RJCB/PLMN HRTY  19/VBMQ RWTP/GLMR TRRC  20/LKFD SPBV/NHDJ PBCX  21/NHDC DKPM/LCML FLTC  </plot>

	<Notes>Armed with an array of Air-Interceptor Missiles, and a 20mm "Vulcan" cannon, you fly a series of blue-water operations while engaging in head-to-head combat with MIG 29s, MIG 24s, and enemy targets. Numerous cockpit computer displays help you splash each enemy bogey with extreme precision, and when you've completed your sortie, attempt a heart-pounding first-person carrier landing that will challenge even the most experienced naval aviator. Fly alone or link up for some gut-wrenching head-to-head four player competition as you battle for supremacy of the skies.</Notes>
