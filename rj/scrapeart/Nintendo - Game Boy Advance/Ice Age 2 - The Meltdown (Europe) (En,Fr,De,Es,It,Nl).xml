	<Name>Ice Age 2 - The Meltdown (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl)</Name>
	<plot>This puzzle-adventure game follows the story of the film, where three companions must navigate a dangerous, thawing world.Players play as all three animal friends, and can switch between them at will to use their distinct abilities to solve each level's terrain hazards. Manny the mammoth can use his great strength to push large boulders, or swim through deep lakes; Diego the sabertooth tiger can swipe his way through thorny bushes and leap chasms; Sid the sloth can melt ice blocks, climb walls, and cross cracking iceflows.Breaking up the puzzle-solving action are several Scrat levels, where players control the hyper rodent through insanely-fast sidescroller levels where he leaps, tunnels, and flies through the scenery to collect his precious acorns.There are over 30 adventure levels, boss levels, and a half-dozen Scrat levels.</plot>

	<Notes>An adventure game based on the sequel to Fox's CG animated film. The Ice Age is ending and our subzero heroes return in this action adventure video game set in a melting paradise of water parks, geysers and tar pits. Manny the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth and Diego the Sabre-Toothed Tiger are back and realize that the melting glaciers will soon flood their valley. With the help of everyone's favorite sabre-toothed squirrel from the first movie, Scrat, help your big friends cross the perilous landscape to safety. Scrat will dig, swim, sniff, spin and roll his in his never-ending quest to collect acorns. In the process, he serves as the unwitting hero in the quest to save the land from a giant flood.</Notes>
