	<plot>Overview:Tekken Advance is a fighting game for the Game Boy Advance. The game has a wide variety of fighters to choose from, and each fighter has a uniquely different fighting style. The game plays similarly to its console predecessors because of the ability to side step and it transcends just two dimensions. In all of the other games in the Tekken series characters would have an ending (excluding the original Tekken where sub-bosses and the final boss Heihachi Mishima didn't have endings) after beating the game once with any character, however in Tekken Advance characters did not have an ending. This game used Tekken 3 sprites and storyline it also introduced the new tag system which was originally used in Tekken Tag Tournament, a non-canon game in the Tekken series, and has yet to be reused in any of the following games. This was also the first handheld game in the Tekken series.Fighters:Jin KazamaNina WilliamsForrest LawYoshimitsuGun JackLing XiaoyuPaul PhoenixKingHeihachi Mishima (Unlockable only by ending the game with all of the other playable characters)Cheat: Unlock All CharactersWhile in the main screenCheat: Secret CostumesYes, there is a code for one costume (press START to get a secret one) but there is another one you can get by selecting the character by pressing R.Cheat: Secret CostumesPress START at the character list to get a special costume color for each character.</plot>
