	<Name>Tower SP, The (USA)</Name>
	<plot>The Tower SP is an in-depth sim experience that allows the player to design, build, and manage every aspect of successfully creating a skyscraper. Players decide where to place apartments, hotel rooms, office spaces, restaurants, commercial shops, elevators, and a multitude of other construction items in their building. As the tower grows, players have to deal with a multitude of real life situations such as fires, insect infestations, burglaries, and of course the occasional unhappy tenant. Only with savvy design and wise management skills will the player's tower attract masses of patrons and tenants. The main goal in The Tower SP is to achieve a 'Five Star' building rating and gain official 'Tower' status. This can only be achieved by completing specific objectives and creating a building that is a marvel of both efficiency and design. Happy tenants play a large roll in the building's success. A large tenant base insures income to the building, but it is imperative that the building management keep its tenants happy. Unhappy tenants will vacate their offices, apartments, and hotel rooms, thus affecting the player's bottom line and the building's 'Star' rating.</plot>
