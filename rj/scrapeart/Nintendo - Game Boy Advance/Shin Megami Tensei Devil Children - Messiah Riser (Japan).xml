	<Name>Shin Megami Tensei Devil Children - Messiah Riser (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Long time ago, a powerful demon was captured and sealed within a contraption that was called "Messiah Riser". At present time, an evil empire is trying to find a key that would unlock Messiah Riser and unleash the power of the fiend. Two children Jin and Akira, the heroes of  DemiKids, called "The Devil Children" thanks to their unique ability to communicate with demons, decide to confront the empire and to stop their evil plan."Messiah Riser" is a part of Devil Children games, which are a branch of Megaten game franchise, directed towards younger players. Like in all Megaten games, the trademark of "Messiah Riser" is the ability to communicate with demons you fight and to make them help you in battles. You can play the game as either Jin or Akira (the choice will influence the storyline). The battles are now a mixture between turn-based and real time style: enemies will perform a move even if you wait and do nothing, so quick thinking is necessary for combat. After an enemy is defeated, you can talk to it and try to persuade it to join your party. Demons will then fight for you, controlled as playable characters. Like in "mature" Megami Tensei games, you can fuse two demons to create a more powerful one.</plot>
