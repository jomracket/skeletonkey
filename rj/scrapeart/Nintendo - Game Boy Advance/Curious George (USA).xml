	<Name>Curious George (USA)</Name>
	<plot>When a curious monkey with a habit of accidentally causing mischief encounters a man dressed in yellow exploring the jungle, he follows him and stows away on his ship.  Now, the monkey, George, is stuck in the city and needs to find his way back home!  Help George find Ted, the Man in the Yellow Hat.Curious George is a platform game based on the movie of the same name.  In it, you play as the monkey, George, as he jumps, climbs and swings his way through the jungle, a ship, a city and more.  Throughout each level are fireflies, scattered to lead you in the right direction.  For every 50 George collects, he earns an extra life.  Due to his inquisitive nature, George likes to touch objects.  By pressing "R", George will interact with any nearby object with an exclamation mark next to it - and usually cause it to break.</plot>
