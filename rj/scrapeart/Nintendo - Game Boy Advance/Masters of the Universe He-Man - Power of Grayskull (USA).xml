	<plot>Based off the updated cartoon of the popular '80's toy, Masters of the Universe - He-Man: Power of Greyskull puts players in the role of He-Man as he hacks and slashes through a 13-level quest to confront the evil Skeletor.Taking a nod to such classic beat-em ups like Golden Axe or Gauntlet, He-Man makes his way through the various areas of Eternia fighting hordes of Skeletor's underlings while searching for keys to open doors, power-ups to enhance strength and defense, and He-Man's captured friends, such as Man-At-Arms or Cringer.  He-Man can stop the enemies from advancing upon him by destroying the warp portals that are scattered throughout the area.Along the way, He-Man can even ride on Battle Cat through "shooter" style levels to get to new areas and face Skeletor's main minions, such as Beast Man and Clawful.Masters of the Universe - He-Man: Power of Greyskull uses a password save to mark player's progress throughout the game.Cheat: Passwords for All Stages.Stage 2  - HMNCLDNT Stage 3  - HVDNBTTA Stage 4  - VLNTFFRT Stage 5  - FHSMBSHS Stage 6  - BHLDNGTL Stage 7  - THNKYKMN Stage 8  - THSNRSTR Stage 9  - DMGRBSGV Stage 10 - WTCHTHMN Stage 11 - FLLYRSTR Stage 12 - DMGSHANS Stage 13 - WRKLKDMG</plot>

	<Notes>Eternia was once a place of beauty and safety. Protected by the Masters of the Universe and the Mystic Wall, this sacred land could never be touched by the evil of the outside world. But one dark day Skeletor and his evil warriors were able to breach the Mystic Wall. Their relentless attacks have pushed the Masters of the Universe to their edge-and now, yet another wave of attacks. It's clear only one man can protect this land and keep its people safe - He-Man, the most powerful man in the universe! Can you, as He-Man, push back the evil beasts to the Dark Hemisphere? Test your skills and discover if you are worthy of being He-Man.</Notes>
