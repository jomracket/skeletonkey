	<plot>Overview: You can't go there Urban Yeti. That's a toll bridge.     Urban Yeti! is a top down open world game for the Game Boy Advance. The game play is similar to Grand Theft Auto Advance, but the player controls a  Yeti rather than a human gangster.  However, the lack of a map or radar make navigating around the city a frustrating task. The storyline involves a Yeti that moves to the inner city to find a wife and start a family. The player can find a floating newspaper that allows the Yeti to work at one of four different jobs. Each job involves a different mini-game that play similarly to classic arcade games. For example, there is a Frisbee tournament that plays similarly to Discs of Tron. Cheat: Level PasswordsEnter the Password</plot>

	<Notes>Urban Yeti is is a smooth scrolling 2 1/2-D platform adventure, and might very well be the strangest game you've ever played. You can smash your way through 4 twisting city stages, or attempt to avoid detection all together. Either way the Human AI will adapt as you progress - the more contact you have, the more aggressive they'll become. There are even some unique minigames to add to the excitement - Yeti Frisbee, managing the local "Yeti Kingdom Of Eats" restaurant, and catching poultry to offer to your prospective mate. You can even float down a lazy sewer river o' fun on a giant tube! Achieve the ultimate goal and show the world just what kind of Bigfoot you really are.</Notes>
