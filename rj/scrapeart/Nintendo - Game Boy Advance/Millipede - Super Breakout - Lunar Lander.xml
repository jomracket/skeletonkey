	<Plot>Millipede: You must stop a horde of rampaging bugs which have invaded your mushroom garden. Earwigs, Inchworms, Dragonflies, and Beetles are all out to make sure this battle is your last. Shoot all of the bugs before they bite you! Super Breakout: This updated version of one of the greatest coin-op classics offers all of the game variations that the original game offered. The goal is simply to knock out all of the visible bricks using as few balls as possible. Lunar Lander is the first one player game to authentically simulate an actual moon landing mission. It provides the thrills and the realistic "feel" of controlled space flight! Players are challenged to control thrust and rotation of a lunar landing craft to counteract simulated gravitational pull, momentum and friction.</Plot>
