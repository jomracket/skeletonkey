However, during the tournament, Mega Man and LAN discover a plot by an evil corporation, who hope to once again take over the network.Using an RPG style, you must guide Mega Man through various levels defeating enemies along the way and collecting the various chips to upgrade Mega Man's weapons and other items.Exclusive to this, the White Version, are specialy developed chips (Giga Class chips) that only the White Version of Mega Man can use.

Those gates have question marks on them, and you must fulfill a certain requirement within that area of the Internet, then go to the gate in order to open it and proceed to the next Internet area. Here's a quick list of requirements to get into the later areas: Area 11: You cannot escape any battles in Area 10. Area 12: Busting Level after every battle must be above 3 in Area 11.

Go to the deepest Internet Area (Internet Area 16, in the area where you can get Paradin Sword). Walk around that area until you find him. He can appear everywhere in that area. If you can beat him, he should give you the Dream Aura chip. Please remember, Forte CAN'T give his chip to you.Cheat: Entering Deeper Parts of the InternetIn the School's computer network, there are several doors you'll come to that require you to input a 2-digit passcode.
