	<Name>Super Bubble Pop (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl,Pt,Sv)</Name>
	<plot>A combination of Tetris and Bust-A-Move, Super Bubble Pop has you controlling a character along the bottom of the playfield, who you use to throw bubbles of different colours towards the other side of the playfield. As you throw them down the line, they will stack up in piles of six. Linking three bubbles together will pop them (remove them from the field), and if there is a stack of six, the bubbles on the way will form a new stack in front of it.The aim of the game is to remove all bubbles from the field, but there is another way of completing a game. Tokens will appear during play, and by collecting enough, you can move on to the next round regardless of what you have on the playfield.</plot>

	<Notes>Publisher Jaleco Entertainment steps back into the gaming arena with a bubble-popping puzzle game. The quirky title, which was developed by Runecraft Software, lets players choose a character from a selection of five dancing DJs and selecting a skill level, players jump immediately into the guts of the game. The point is to maneuver the selected DJ from left to right and shoot bubbles at their colored counterparts as they slowly advance across a nine-by-nine grid. It's fairly simple stuff, but it is made slightly more complicated as three matching bubbles, be them in horizontal or vertical form, cancel each other out, award players points, and help clear the battlefield.</Notes>
