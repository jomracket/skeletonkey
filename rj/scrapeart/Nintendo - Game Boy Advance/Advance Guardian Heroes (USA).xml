	<plot>Advance Guardian Heroes is the follow-up to the Sega Saturn classic Guardian Heroes. It's a side-scrolling, beat-em-up action game. You choose from 3 characters who will be joined by a legendary Soul Hero from another world. You must take control of the Legendary Soul Sword from the Soul Hero's grave and save the world.There are 2 game modes, story mode which you can play by yourself or cooperatively with another player by linking two GBA's together. There is also a VS. mode where up to 4 players can battle each other. In Story mode you receive crystals from your defeated enemies. At the end of each level you can upgrade traits like MP or HP, or you can donate to the Laboratory which will eventually unlock characters to use in VS. mode. There are 3 initial characters available, but up to 20 are unlockable.Cheat: Unlock All CharactersAt the Treasure logo at the start of the game, quickly enter the following:Right, Left, L, R, Up, Select, Select. You'll hear Zur laugh if done correctly. Everything will be unlocked until you restart the game.Cheat: Unlimited Invincible Body TimeWhen you die, the end boss shows up and says something like "If you sell me your soul, I'll give you an invincable body for a while. what do you say?" Say yes and while your soul is being sucked up by the big blue beam, press ALL the buttons on your gameboy randomly. The glitch only works if you are only pressing the buttons while your soul is being sucked up. Afterwards you should see your time says 999 and never goes down.Cheat: Easy EXP CrystalsGet up to Stage 3-16 (the place where you only encounter 2 knights on a long metal bridge) And keep fighting the 2 knights, but staying at the left screen. Get any EXP Crystal they drop, and go back to the left agian. You can get up to 99999 quickly.</plot>
