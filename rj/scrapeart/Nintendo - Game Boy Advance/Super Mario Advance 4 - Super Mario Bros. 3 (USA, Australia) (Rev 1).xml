	<plot>Bowser is back, and along with the Bowser kids, he's out to spoil Mario's day once again.This time, along with nabbing the Princess, the Bowser crew have also taken the magic wands from the Kings of each land and turned them into creatures. It's up to Mario and Luigi to get back the magic wands, defeat Bowser, and save the Princess all before the day is done.Old and new power-ups abound in each level for the Mario Brothers, including the return of the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower, plus the new power-ups including the frog suit, the warp flute, and the most important of all, the leaf, which allows you to fly and attack enemies with your tail.http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/super-mario-bros-3Cheat: Many Tanooki SuitsIn World 5 (Cloud World), the first available mushroom house has a Tanooki Suit. Get it and beat levels until you get to the cloud part of the world by beating the spiral tower. The game offers to save your game. Save it, then get game over. When you continue, you keep the Tanooki Suit you got at the mushroom house, and the mushroom house has returned! All of the other levels remain defeated as well, though the spiral tower remains standing, so you cna beat it and save your game, get game over, and get another Tanooki Suit each time! The suits make good replacements for leaves, mushrooms, and useless items (like music boxes) in your item list. Glitch only works for World 5 due to the ability to beat the spiral tower as many times as you want and save after each time.Cheat: 1,000,000 StarFor every 1,000,000 points you earn, a star will appear above the title Super Mario Bros. 3 (where you select between Super Mario Bros. 3 or Mario Bros.)

You can get up to 5 stars maximum.Cheat: 1,000,000 StarTo replay any level, fortress, and castle, beat every level in the game. Not just Bowser, every single level.Cheat: 1,000,000 StarIf you manage to ''beat'' a spade house (by correctly matching the pieces into any of the 3 forms), you can unlock additional houses! In addition, you can create different combos that can get you even more lives! Heart house: Star is replaced with a racoon leaf, and matching it rewards you with 7 lives Club House: Star/Leaf is replaces with the number ''3'', matching this awards you 9 lives Diamond House: All items are replaced with stars..a Guarenteed win! Once you have passed a diamond house, the cycle repeats itself.Cheat: 1,000,000 StarBeat the game clearing every single level (90 in total). Once Bowser is defeated, save and you will be brought to a World Selection screen where you can jump to any of the 8 worlds. All locked doors will have been unlocked and you can freely visit any stage/bonus stage/castle/etc.Cheat: 1,000,000 StarAfter you beat the whole game, special coins at the beginning of the secret levels: Levels and required coins:  1-4, 2-2, 3-8, 4-2, 5-5, 6-7, 7-2 Each will have a number on the bottom of the screen telling you how many coins in that level you need to get a white mushroom popup on the map. Once you achieve that many coins, the white mushroom house icon will show up.Cheat: Behind-The-ScenesIn most levels, there are multi-colored blocks held up by screws. With the white ones, you can drop behind the scenes to escape enemies or find secret exits by holding down on the d-pad for 5 seconds.
