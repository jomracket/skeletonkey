	<Notes>The Game Boy Advance version of Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 captures most of the over-the-top action found in the N64 version, and the training mini-games help to add a little variety to the gameplay. From Mama Tua's 400 pounds of fury to Afro Thunder's funky taunts, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 lives up to its rep for absurd arcade action. Midway has proven itself to be a heavyweight when it comes to arcade-style sports games, with heavy-hitting titles like NFL Blitz and NBA Showtime proving that it can walk the walk as well as talk the talk. Now Midway is bringing its popular Ready 2 Rumble franchise to Game Boy Advance, complete with a 3D rotating ring and 11 boxers bursting with attitude.</Notes>
