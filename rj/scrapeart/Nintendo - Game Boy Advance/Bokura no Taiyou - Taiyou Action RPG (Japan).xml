	<plot>Boktai: The Sun Is in Your Hand is the first Game Boy Advance game that uses sunlight to influence gameplay. In the game, you'll follow the adventures of Django, a young vampire hunter on a quest to rid the world of evil. As Django, you must overcome traps, defeat enemies, and fight through the deepest parts of dungeons. Watch out for the amount of sunlight--Django is stronger by day, while the vampires are stronger by night. The game features a solar sensor on the cartridge and a real-time clock system.Cheat: Easy Life FruitIn a room in the Abyss, enter the following:Cheat: Infinite Sunlight1. Get a tonniar rm. You can get one from the Count by burning him with a skylight. 2. Observe what time the sun rises in your game (by going into an Immortal dungeon at night), then save in the area with the solar tree 3. Set the time in the main menu ''Options'' screen to one minute before your sunrise (such as 5:59) 4. Hurry and get under the solar tree. At the crack of dawn, dew will fall and convert your tonniar into a Mr. RainNot. 5. Walk east one screen and use Mr. RainNot. You now have two bars of sunlight at all times until the next sundown. Now, to keep your sunlight permanently, each time you play boktai set the clock to daytime of the day you used the Rainnot. With this method you will have sunlight, day or night, every time you play boktai!Cheat: Dark Gun PiecesComplete the following tasks to unlock the 3 pieces for the dark gun (all 3 must be acquired in order to use them)Cheat: Dark Gun PiecesEmblems allow you to open locked doors in Asure Sky Tower.
