	<Name>Lizzie McGuire 3 - Homecoming Havoc (USA)</Name>
	<plot>Lizzie McGuire's cheerleading rival, Kate, has boasted that there will be no way Lizzie will be Homecoming Queen with the unbeatable competition of Kate.  Previously uninterested in Homecoming, Lizzie suddenly develops a fierce determination to show up Kate and swipe the crown from her clutches.Homecoming Havoc plays somewhat like Nintendo's Wario Ware, in that players must make their way through a series of short mini-games rapidly thrown at you one after the other.  While each of Wario Ware's stages has a theme, each of Homecoming Havoc's minigames in the ten stages are randomly selected from the game's minigame library.As players progress through the minigames, they earn points and tokens.  Tokens can be used to purchase cards that will allow you to skip a particular type of minigame if you fail it.  At the end of each set of ten minigames, there is a Dance Competition.  In this game, players must input the correct arrow sequence using the Control Pad as the arrows pass along the screen.</plot>
