	<Notes>Everyone's favorite coach-turned commentator is back with another dose of hard-hitting pigskin. MADDEN NFL's signature style goes to the next level in this unbelievable game, delivering realistic football physics and photo-quality cutscenes. You'll have access to all of the real NFL teams and players all with accurate uniforms, abilities, and appearances. All of the standard modes of play are included, and there are a few new entries, such as Two-Minute Drill (earn points on offense by moving the ball quickly up the field) and Create-a-Team (build your franchise from the ground up including uniforms, helmets, and coaching philosophy). Coach's Corner will teach you about all the ins and outs of NFL Football, and all of the action is called by (you guessed it) John Madden, himself. All of the real playbooks and coaching strategies of the pro teams are at your fingertips, so you have no excuse for losing in this one, folks.</Notes>
