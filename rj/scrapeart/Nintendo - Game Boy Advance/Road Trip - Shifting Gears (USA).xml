You'll never be bored from doing the same thing on the same track.Enjoy tracks that are paved, sand, and snow.  Also, enjoy racing in the rain where traction is poor.  With the right upgrades to your car, you can handle these dangers.  Without them, you may not finish in the top 3.In order to progress in the challenges, you need to finish in the top 3 in each race.
