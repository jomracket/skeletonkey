	<Name>Rocket Power - Beach Bandits (USA) (v0.14) (Beta)</Name>
	<plot>Summer is just around the corner, and the kids from Ocean Shores look forward to the Annual Ocean Shores Surf Contest. But as Otto, Reggie, Twister, and Sam finally reach the beach, they make a startling discovery--most of the sand is missing, and the surf contest has been postponed. Now it's up to you to guide the kids through Ocean Shores, The Lakes, The Robot Factory, and Mondo Mountain in the effort to discover who stole the sand. In each area, you'll battle robot minions, use the new wave runner and zip-line glide, and play extreme sports, such as skateboarding and inline skating.http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/home/582263.htmlCheat: Secret LevelEnter the following at the password screen:</plot>

	<Notes>It's summer time at Ocean Shores, but the sand at the beach has magically disappeared. Otto, Reggie, Twister and Sam from Rocket Power are surprised by the sands disappearance, and now want to get the sand back. You have to help them by by going around Ocean Shores to get answers about the places the sand could have been taken, getting help from other residents of Ocean Shores. Use your Hockey Stick to fight robots and destroy the robot panels and collect items like smoke bombs, by riding your skateboard and grinding rails as well.</Notes>
