	<Notes>It's great football action with the Backyard Kids and real pro players as kids. Little football fans will enjoy choosing from all 32 NFL teams or create their own with custom team names and uniforms. Call the plays and direct all the action in single games or an entire season's worth of hard-hitting action. It's the chance of a lifetime to play with the pros right in your own backyard!</Notes>
