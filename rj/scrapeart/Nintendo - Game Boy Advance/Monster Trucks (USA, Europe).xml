	<Notes>Monster Trucks takes all the action and excitement of Monster Truck events and brings them to the Game Boy Advance. Players build their ride in the scrap yard then work their way up to arena competitions in a quest to become the best on the circuit. They must face five different Monster Truck opponents determined to knock them out of the league and can earn money to add new upgrades to their truck and Monster Truck Team.</Notes>
