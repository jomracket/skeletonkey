	<Plot>Pokémon CAWPS is the first Pokémon hack which is never be the same as the others before. Usually, players become a hero-trainer in a Pokémon game and have a mission: save the world from an evil team with a bad ambition, bla bla bla… With CAWPS, no! In this game, you will take the role of a Police Officer in Hoenn region. People here are not the normal like usual, they are more realistic (maybe you can call them insane). A lot of violence and death are depicted in this game. So, CAWPS is really a Pokémon game for adults and it is not for young children.</Plot>
