	<Notes>Super Robot Wars Destiny is a turn-based strategic game featuring many famous Japanese mecha animes. It was the fourth of the series on the Gameboy Advance and takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, just after the beginning of Getter Robo Armageddon, where a nuclear explosion wipes out the majority of humanity. While other factions are doing their own activities, they are shocked to discover the Earth is sealed, having disappeared from the face of the universe. The three main protagonists must find out the reason behind the sealing and how to stop it. On the course of the journey, the player will engage against the antagonist Ruina, a destructive race bent on seeing the rest of the universe in ruins.</Notes>
