The Android/Cell saga is regarded by fans to be the highlight of the Dragon Ball Z series.The plot starts off with Frieza remaining alive after his defeat from Goku on  planet Namek. He and his father,  King Cold, head to Earth to seek revenge off Earth's main hero,  Goku. But to their surprise, a hero from out of no where appears and tells him that he will be the to destroy him. Frieza at first doesn't take him seriously, he does what he could to destroy Trunks, but fails. Soon after that, Trunks transforms into a super-saiyan and destroys Frieza. Not long after that, he destroys King Cold and the spaceship they flew on.After that, Goku finally arrives on Earth and  Trunks explains who he really is and what's going to happen three years into the future. An evil force that are these two androids will arrive on Earth to destroy all lifeforms, which includes all of Earth's special forces. Goku on the other hand, dies of a virus earlier on. Trunks explains all that to him and then gives Goku a cure for the virus that he may suffer in the future.Trunks leaves to go back to his own time and Goku tells everyone what's going to happen. Everyone then begins to train for the upcoming event.Gameplay:One of the new features in the game.The game features a number of new features; such as a more non-linear progression, the ability to control other characters in the Dragon Ball Z series, side quests, and more techniques to use during combat.The story progression is more non-linear than the original game, the player can step outside of the story and explore other areas that the game contains. The new feature in the game is the ability to travel from area to area via flying - the game has a 3D section where the player can fly in any direction once the player leaves the area that he or she is in. Some of the areas are some of the famous location that was feature in the anime series, like  Kami's lookout tower, Goku's home, and Capsule Corp.One of the most noticeable feature in the game is to control other characters.
