	<plot>It is the dawn of a new age...And the heroes of Golden Sun have been abandoned. Now, the world is falling into darkness.

Pursued by the heroes of the original Golden Sun, they must race to complete their quest before the world becomes lost to the ages.Cheat: Enter last town visitedWhen you load a saved game, hold the L+R+Start buttons while you load the game.

Go in the boat and instead of pressing b to fly, go into your psyenergy menu and select hover. The boat will rise and then fall but the bar will still be there and it won't go down (you won't lose PP). During that time the game will think you are flying, so no monsters will attack you and you will hear the flying noise and music (but you aren't flying). The glitch stays until you press B. In which the flying music will get louder and you will actually fly.Cheat: Avoid water monsters and waste almost no PPThe glitch at the Trial Road Dungeon makes copies of items in the artifact inventories of the shops.  From the time that Moapa opens the dungeon and until Felix beats Moapa every item that Felix and friends drop will be returned to Felix inventory when he leaves Trial Road.  Entering dropped items in the artifact inventory of the shops is already part of the game design.  Only the Laughing Fungus, Large Bread, Bone, Smoke Bombs, Sleep Bombs, Bramble Seeds, Oil Drops, Crystal Powder, and Weasel Claws will not be copied to the shop inventory.Cheat: Avoid water monsters and waste almost no PP When you enter trial road as soon as you control Felix drop an item you want to duplicate and then leave Trial Road.

Hit the A button to get off your ship and you should end up on the other side of the mountains! All of the towns are gone, except for Vale, but you can't enter it. All of the caves are gone, so you can't explore the entire world. The only other visible places are Venus Lighthouse and Babi Lighthouse. You won't be able to reach either of them, though.Cheat: Listen to all Golden Sun musicGo into Battle Mode on the title screen (must be Golden Sun: The Lost Age), and walk over to the woman on the far left.
