Some levels you will play as Elastigirl and you will use her powers to defeat different enemies. When you play as Dash the levels are timed, and are essentially races where you use his super speed to navigate the levels. Violet is only used once, and in this level you use her invisibility to sneak past enemies.Cheat: Cheat PasswordsEnter this password in the password screen in the main menuCheat: Level PasswordsInput these in the password menu, on the main screen.Cheat: Level PasswordsEnter this at the password screen, in the main menu.Cheat: Level PasswordsEnter this password in the password screen in the main menu</plot>
