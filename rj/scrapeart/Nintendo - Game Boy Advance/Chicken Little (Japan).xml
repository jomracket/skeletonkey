	<Notes>Walt Disney Pictures' Chicken Little catapults players smack dab into the middle of Oakey Oaks, Chicken Little's hometown, where they experience first-hand all of the action, humor, fun and heart-warming adventure as portrayed in the film. Taking on the roles of Chicken Little and his friends Abby Mallard, Runt-of-the-Litter and Fish-out-of-Water, players must try to outwit bully Foxy Loxy and save the town from an alien invasion all the while attempting to reverse Chicken Little's tarnished reputation from that unfortunate "acorn incident." You know, the one where he shouted, "The sky is falling!" causing mass chaos in the town of Oakey Oaks, and earning him the reputation of town fool.</Notes>
