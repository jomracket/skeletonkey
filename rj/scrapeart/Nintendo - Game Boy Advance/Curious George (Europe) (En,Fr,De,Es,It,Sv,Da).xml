In it, you play as the monkey, George, as he jumps, climbs and swings his way through the jungle, a ship, a city and more.  Throughout each level are fireflies, scattered to lead you in the right direction.  For every 50 George collects, he earns an extra life.  Due to his inquisitive nature, George likes to touch objects.  By pressing "R", George will interact with any nearby object with an exclamation mark next to it - and usually cause it to break.</plot>

When the Man with the Yellow Hat travels to Africa in search of a lost artifact, he returns with some unexpected cargo -- a curious little primate named George. Guide George as he runs, jumps, climbs and swings his way through a variety of adventure-packed levels from the jungle to the Big City, where his spunky and fun-loving nature endears him to new friends and lands him in a series of mis-adventures. Make monkey business as you help George and his friends discover the one item special enough to save the museum from the bulldozer. Loads of bonus content and challenging mini-games keep players busy long after the main story is done.</Notes>
