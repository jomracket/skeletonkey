	<Name>Breath of Fire (USA)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Breath of Fire was originally developed and released by Capcom in Japan in 1993 for the SNES, and a year later licensed by Squaresoft for release in North America. It was Capcom's first foray into the role-playing genre. The game was mostly well-received by critics, but was criticized for its linear story progression and frequent random enemy encounters.Capcom later released a GBA remake in 2001 that included some minor additions and tweaks to the game. Among these additions were new character portraits, new additional illustrated cutscenes, the ability to dash, and tweaks to the overall difficulty of the game. Players could also swap items between their inventories with the use of a game link cable.Story:Spurned by the evil goddess Tyr, the Light Dragon Clan and the Dark Dragon Clan had been at war for eons, destroying the land they once governed together. Out of the war-torn people arose a young hero and his seven companions. On a treacherous journey, they managed to capture Mila and seal her away in a dungeon locked with six keys. A fragile peace has since returned to the lands as the Light Dragons work to resolve differences with the Dark Dragons. Will the forces of Light and Dark return peace to the land, or will history repeat itself? Join Ryu and his companions as the future of the Dragon Clan unfolds.Main CharactersRyuRyuThe hero of this game. He is a boy from the light Dragon clan who lives with his sister Sara.

When he asks you to put coins on the table, and he'll make them disappear, agree to it. When he says ''Look behind you'', say No twice, then Yes once. After that, you should see Chun-Li practicing her Lightning Kick.Cheat: Chun-Li CameoUse Agni the best dragon spell against the Last Boss the Goddess. She will become her ultimate form. When you beat her you will get the "GOOD" Ending. At the end of the good ending you will see Nina, and Ryu smiling with a "The End" message, but wait about 15 seconds, and the old Ryu from Breath of Fire II will appear with a "To Be Continued" message. This is an added cookie exclusive to the GBA Breath of Fire, implying to play the GBA Breath of Fire II.Cheat: Avoid Fighting PogWhen you go to the Dark Dragon's fort in the woods near Tantar/Tuntar, you will talk to a guy that asks you to come with him. Tell him no, and he will ask again. Keep selecting no and Bo will come in and kill him, so you won't have to fight Pog.Cheat: Avoid Fighting PogTo earn a large amount of experience with relative ease, go to Obelisk (the final dungeon of the game.  It is floating in the middle of the red lake south of the town, Carmen).  When you get up to the boss, Jade, he will ask you if you want to join up with him.  Answer "Yes" and you will now be on his "side."  DON'T PRESS ANY BUTTON AT THIS POINT!!!  After waiting for a while, Jade will tell you that he is bored and that he would like for you and your party to entertain him.  Then, you will be forced into battles with easy enemies (one enemy per battle).  After a few battles, you will fight a monster called M.Slime.  Defeating it will give your party 9999 Experience Points and 9999 Gold.  Repeat the process for tons of Experience Points and Gold.  To end the "Loop", press any button while waiting and tell him that you "change your mind."  </plot>
