	<Plot>Every night, in cities like LA, Philly, and Miami, crews of import tuners push their nitrous-injected obsessions to the limit. Whether in under- ground or sanctioned races, on the track or through the wide open city streets, high speeds bring high risks. And serious rush. In the Street Racing Syndicate, choose your races carefully. Your opponent could have more under the hood than it seems. Consider this your initiation into the underground world of street racing.</Plot>
