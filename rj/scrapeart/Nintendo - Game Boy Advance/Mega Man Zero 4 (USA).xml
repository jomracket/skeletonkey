	<Name>Mega Man Zero 4 (USA)</Name>
	<plot>New Features Some of the new features on MegaMan Zero 4 included Zero's new weapon, the Zero Knuckle. this replaced the Boomerang Shield of        the previous game, and served as a memento of the Weapon-Get system used in the       original Mega Man games, except instead of receiving the boss' weapon, Zero was able to take weapons away from the stage enemies and use them for a short period of time.     I'll take that, if ya don't mind.
