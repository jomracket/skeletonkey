	<Plot>Centipede: Watch out! Here comes the slithering Centipede, the poisonous scorpion, a mischievous spider, and pesky flea! Aim your magic wand and shoot sparks to stop these pests in their tracks. Breakout: SMASH! POW! CRUNCH! A brick wall appears at the top of the screen, and your mission is to smash two walls off the playfield-one brick at a time. Warlords: King Frederick's warlords have been battling for many centuries and now it's up to you to carry on their long-standing feud. Dominick, Marcus, Felipe, and Restivo have been locked inside this Game Program. They've stored enough fireballs and lightning balls so that they'll never run out, and neither will you. So good luck, you're in for some fierce competition.</Plot>
