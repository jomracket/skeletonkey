	<Name>Pokemon - Edicion Esmeralda (Spain)</Name>
	<plot>Like previous Pok&amp;eacute;mon games, Emerald challenges you to collect, trade, and battle Pok&amp;eacute;mon. In this extension of Pok&amp;eacute;mon Ruby and Pok&amp;eacute;mon Sapphire, you must stop Team Magma and Team Aqua from expanding and taking over the world of Hoenn. Help maintain the balance by bringing your strategies and tactics onto all-new battlefields. In addition to single-player challenges, the game features multiplayer trading and battling with up to four players using a wireless adapter.Cheat: Level Up Unhatched PokemonTo do this glitch, you must first execute the Pomeg Berry Glitch, which is done by using a Pomeg Berry on a Pokemon with 1 or 2 HP so that its HP loops to 65,535 (displayed as ?35 in-game). Do so, however, with only one Pokemon and an Egg in the party, with the Egg in the top-leftmost slot of the party in the Pokemon menu. After executing the glitch, you will now be able to enter battles and use the Pokemon Egg as if it were a normal Pokemon. It will function as a normal Pokemon - you can view the stats it will have upon hatching, it can level-up by beating Pokemon, it can learn new moves, it can even evolve. This means that you can alter the Pokemon inside the Egg in otherwise-illegitimate ways. For example. Pikachu cannot normally know Thunder when hatching from an Egg at Level 5; through this glitch, Pikachu can. Similarly, you can hatch Eggs with fully-evolved Pokemon such as Typhlosion, Meganium, and so on, inside.Cheat: Level Up Unhatched PokemonFor this glitch to work properly, you must have a Pomeg Berry and a Pokemon who has not had their HP lowered as much as possible already through Pomeg Berries. (If the latter is the case, the use of HP Ups on the Pokemon will suffice.) Get the Pokemon to a severely low level of HP (1 or 2 HP). Once you do so, in the field, use the Pomeg Berry on the Pokemon. This will in turn cause the data in their HP to cycle back to the top of the counter, giving the affected Pokemon 65,535 HP - over 90 times the otherwise possible maximum in the game.Cheat: Altering CaveYou can go to Altering Cave after you beat the Elite Four. It is located on Route 103. Cheat: Altering CaveOnce you beat the game, you can go to the Battle Frontier.Cheat: Altering CaveTell the Berry Master's Wife certain phrases to receive the following berries.
