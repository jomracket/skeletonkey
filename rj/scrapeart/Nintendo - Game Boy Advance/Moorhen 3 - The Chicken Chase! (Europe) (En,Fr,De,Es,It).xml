	<Name>Moorhen 3 - The Chicken Chase! (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)</Name>
	<plot>Moorhen 3 ...Chicken Chase is a shooter still in the same style as the first Moohrhuhn. The player has a gun and he shoots chickens which fly over the screen. If they are far away, they give more points. After six shots the player has to reload the weapon (which gives a time penalty). The time is limited, the screen can be scrolled left and right and the ultimate goal is to improve the own highscore.In this game the only background is set at a sea. New features are more different animals to shoot, including the "Lessh?hner" which give negative points. Two new ammo types are more powerful but limited and have to be earned by shooting certain things. There are multiple hidden extras to find, e.g. ways to extend the playing time. In the PC version there is an online highscore list.http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/moorhen-3-chicken-chase</plot>
