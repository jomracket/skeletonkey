	<Name>Pac-Man Collection (Europe)</Name>
	<plot>Four classic Pac-Man games are included in this collection from Namco:1. Pac-Man: The original arcade classic, complete and un-cut. 2. Pac-Mania: A conversion of the 1987 update to Pac-Man, which takes the elements of the original arcade game and puts it into an isometric view, as well as adding the ability to jump.3. Pac-Man Arrangement: Never re-produced outside of the arcade, Arrangement again uses the elements of the original Pac-Man and adds a fifth ghost, who can change shape and size when combined with the other 4 ghosts, and make life harder for Pac-Man. New power-ups are also included, like the ability to dash quickly around the screen, warp points to get from one place to the other and new ways of catching ghosts.Pac-Attack: Like Tetris before it, you must fit falling blocks together to complete a line to clear the screen. In this case, the falling tiles also have ghosts in them, and once the Pac-Man tile appears (a tile with the Pac-Man symbol), Pac-Man will eat all of the ghosts that are in his path until he gets to a dead end.Cheat:  Pac-Attack AppendixFirst enter the Pac-Attack game. Then highlight the Puzzle mode option and immediately press Right and A. In this slightly changed version, Pac-Man appears less times and none of the clusters will be random.Cheat: Level PasswordsPlease enter the following at the password screen:Cheat: Level PasswordsIn Pac-Attack, type in the password ''FFF'' and you will be treated to the screen which you normally have to beat all 100 levels to see.Cheat: This password will allow you to use a music test and some other options in the game.</plot>

	<Notes>One of the first video games ever created, PAC-MAN still happens to be one of the best, as well. This comprehensive collection includes three unique Pac-Man titles in one complete package. Inside you'll find the original Pac-Man which has you traversing mazes, avoiding deadly ghosts, and chomping down nutritious dots; Pac-Mania is a 3D take on the first version, in which you can actually jump over the ghosts; and Pac-Attack is a Tetris-like experience that'll have you lining up blocks in a fast-paced environment.</Notes>
