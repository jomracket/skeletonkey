	<Notes>Pinball Advance features the Tarantula, Jailbreak and Daredevil pinball tables, all fully rendered in shiny 3D and each with their own exclusive single and multiball game modes. The Tarantula table will allow budding pinball wizards to venture into the spider?s lair and fight their way onto the scoreboard overcoming the terror of the table. In Jailbreak, players will have to prove their innocence to the judge or escape past the prison guards. Finally, The Daredevil will let players take their chances with the Wheel of Death and The Loop of Fire.</Notes>
