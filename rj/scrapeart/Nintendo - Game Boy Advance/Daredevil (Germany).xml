	<Name>Daredevil (Germany)</Name>
	<plot>New Yorkers begin to question their superhero's allegiance in a game based on the Daredevil movie. The Kingpin, the city's most notorious crime boss, has told the world that Daredevil is his hired gun--and now Daredevil must set the record straight in a deadly showdown. As Daredevil, you'll zip, swing, and dive from rooftops to sewers. When you're not knocking out villains with the billy club, you'll fight them using Daredevil's boxing and martial arts skills. Although Daredevil is blind, he can still see through walls using his radar-sense skills, explore the interactive world of Hell's Kitchen, and interact with a cast of Marvel characters.Cheat: Unlock EverythingAt the main menu pick the ''password'' option and enter in the password 41TK1S6ZNGV and hit END.
