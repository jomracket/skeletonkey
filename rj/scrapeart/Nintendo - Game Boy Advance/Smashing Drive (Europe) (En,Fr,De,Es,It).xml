	<Notes>Some sharp driving will go far in this yellow cab race. Driving to your destination, you'll need to meet the first checkpoint quickly to get the extra time for the second half of the course. Using ramps and going airborne allows you to snatch glide; turbo-boost and other power-ups frowned upon by real-life traffic-enforcement authorities. Instead of taking on a computer opponent, you can battle another player in Head-to-Head mode via the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable. The fast frame rate really gives you a sense of speed in the game. You need to make snap decisions about which corner to take and if you want to avoid that oncoming car or drive right through it.</Notes>
