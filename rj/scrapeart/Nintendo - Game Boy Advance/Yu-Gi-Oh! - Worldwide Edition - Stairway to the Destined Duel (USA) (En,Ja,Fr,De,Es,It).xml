	<Name>Yu-Gi-Oh! - Worldwide Edition - Stairway to the Destined Duel (USA) (En,Ja,Fr,De,Es,It)</Name>
	<plot>The Worldwide Edition of Yu-Gi-Oh! is another chance to play Yu-Gi-Oh! on the Gameboy Advance.  The main point of the game is to allow you to battle others with your Yu-Gi-Oh! deck.  You choose to move to the next area or stay in your current area of the map and battle whoever is there.When you are in the map mode, you have the option of staying where you are and battling anyone in your area who will battle, or moving to an area adjacent to your own.  To help you decide what to do, the map will show you the people in your space and the spaces around your space.  Depending on what is shown to you, you can easily tell if each person wants to talk to you or battle you.  If you have not battled a person yet, you will not be able to see who they are until you choose to battle them (except with a small number of people you already know to start the game).Each week you can get 5 more cards through a magazine that you are given.  If you choose to, you can add these to your deck right away.  Otherwise, you can leave them in your trunk to be added later.Each weekend, you can participate in a tournament if you're in the right location that weekend to do so.  Winning the tournaments can gain you some new cards by opening up new (locked) booster packs of cards that you can choose from when you win battles.As you get more cards, Duelist Points, or just win many times against a single opponent, you will also open up more booster packs to choose from when winning duels.The game also allows for dueling friends using a link cable, or even trading cards with friends.Cheat: Misc. PasswordsOn the main map, press R, then go to the Misc Menu.  Select Password and enter these codes to unlock the corresponding card for your deck.Cheat: Change your target week targetIf you don't like your target week targets press START to bring up the language menu.
