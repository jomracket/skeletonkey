	<Name>Robotech - The Macross Saga (USA, Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl)</Name>
	<plot>A classic 2D shooter based on the Robotech license that mixes side-scrolling and forced perspective gameplay.  Select from 4 characters initially.  There are a total of 6 side scroll and 2 forced perspective levels.  The characters each have 5 abilities that the player can upgrade with experience points earned based on performance in each level.  There are both cooperative (2 player) and deathmatch (4 player) multi-play modes supported via the link cable.Cheat: RT: Macross Saga CheatsThese codes are to be entered at the ''Press Start'' screen (the one with the neat picture of the SDF-1). The indication that the code was entered correctly will be indicated by a chicken clucking (most likely in reference to the Lucky Chicken, not the courage of the player).Cheat: Weapons ModifierThis is a neat code. By using this one, your weapon upgrades do not wear off. Instead, your primary weapon will change when you pick it up.  Note: The speadfire weapon now changes its firing patterns when you move forwards and backwards.  Note: Sometimes, the weapon upgrade pickups become glitchy and fuzzy when this cheat is in effect.  To use this cheat, enter your name as ''*SDF1***.'' This means that you can enter any name that contains ''SDF1'' as long as the fortress's name starts from the second spot. Essentially, your player's name needs to have ''SDF1'' in it starting from the second character. The one I used was ''ASDF1.'' Where the asterisks are located, you can enter any character. Cheat: Character UnlocksFollow the given methods.</plot>

	<Notes>A classic 2D shooter that artfully mixes side-scrolling and forced perspective gameplay. Play as a mighty fighter from the hit Robotech series as you battle to save planet Earth from total destruction. Auto cannon fire lights up the skies in this epic intergalactic war with the Zentradi legions. The best defense that Earth has is the Veritech Valkyrie, a fast-changing fighter that moves through the air with the grace of a dancer and packs the punch of an armored division!</Notes>
