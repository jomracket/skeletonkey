	<Name>Wings (Europe)</Name>
	<plot>You are an allied fighter pilot in WW1, duking it out with the "Huns" up in the sky in over 200 missions.The missions usually come in three flavors: Top-down view bombing missions where you have to take out strategically important targets, isometric strafing runs where you get to blast anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of course the main part: Dogfights in the sky. Rendered in 3D, seems from behind your head.The game is set in the years 1916 through 1918, and to loosen things up a little, we get to read a page of our character's new entry for the diary-like journal in his company between every mission.</plot>

	<Notes>Relive 1916 as the Allied Forces desperately need pilots! Young soldiers surge to the Allied armies in an attempt to join the honorable elite: the World War I fighter pilots. Armed with courage and lead alike, these young pilots must claw their way up the ranks, and become one of the proud few that not only defend a nation, but defend the world, from the tyranny of the Huns. Fill the shoes of a rookie pilot, green from inexperience yet eager to take flight and begin what could be a fantastic -- if not legendary -- career. With the help of friends and comrades, you must battle your way up the ranks in over 200 increasingly challenging missions!</Notes>
