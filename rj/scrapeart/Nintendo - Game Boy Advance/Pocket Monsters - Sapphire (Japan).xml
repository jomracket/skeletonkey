	<plot>The race to catch 'em all is on again in Pok&amp;eacute;mon Sapphire.This entry in the Pok&amp;eacute;mon series features an all-new storyline, awesome new Pok&amp;eacute;mon, and addictive RPG gameplay.One of the biggest additions to Pok&amp;eacute;mon Sapphire is the two-on-two battle system, which allows you to link up with three friends to battle competitively or cooperatively.You can also showcase your Pok&amp;eacute;mon's coolness, beauty, cuteness, smartness, and toughness in Pok&amp;eacute;mon contests.With new Pok&amp;eacute;mon, two-on-two battles, and an all-new region of Hoenn to explore, Pok&amp;eacute;mon Sapphire takes the Pok&amp;eacute;mon experience to the next level.Cheat: Capture Trainer PokemonFor this glitch to work, you need to have not caught the Latios (Sapphire) or Latias (Ruby) roaming in Hoenn. (Note that this glitch means that, on this file, you cannot capture that Pokemon without trading.) Enter a trainer battle of some sort; this Trainer must have the Pokemon you wish to catch, exactly as that Pokemon is. You can, for example, enter Battle Tower battles to obtain a quick Level 100 Pokemon. (Note that non-Battle Tower Pokemon may turn into Bad Eggs!) Lose to the trainer and then proceed to beat Latios or Latias without having any battles - wild or Trainer - in-between. You MUST make the Latios or Latias faint in that one encounter, without catching them or them escaping. Repels are useful to circumvent wild battles, and Mean Look and Shadow Tag to prevent Latios/Latias from leaving.Cheat: Capture Trainer PokemonAfter beating Latios/Latias, Pokemon #2-#6 of the previous Trainer's party will be used right after that, as if the Latios/Latias were their first Pokemon. These Pokemon will fight, however, as wild, roaming Pokemon do and thus are capable of escaping like Latios/Latias are. Still, you are nonetheless able to capture them as your own. The battle ends with the first Pokemon you catch, so if you want to catch a different Pokemon in the opponent's party, you'll have to defeat the others until you reach it; this can make for some easy EXP. as well.Cheat: Battle Tower UnlockablesYou can win certain items after battling at the Battle Tower long enough. All wins must be in a single winning streak.Cheat: Battle Tower UnlockablesFirst go to a PokeMart that sells regular Pokeballs. For every 10 Pokeballs you buy, you get 1 Premier Ball free.Cheat: Battle Tower UnlockablesBy walking through the gray-white ash on route 113. You will first need the Ash Sack, by talking to the man in the only house on that route. If you talk to him again after gathering some ash, he will have the following options available for you to choose from. Each step in an ash covered patch of grass counts as one unit. You must leave and re-enter an area to reset the ash.Cheat: Battle Tower UnlockablesAfter you defeat the Elite Four, check TVs in people's houses. If the TV is flashing, check it, and it may say the clearout sale is happening in this many days. Go to the roof of the Lilycove Department Store that may days later, and talk to the lady in the apron to buy any of the following items.Cheat: Battle Tower UnlockablesSurf Northwest of Mossdeep to find a house.  The man inside is the Shard Hunter.  If you explore the Eastern reigon of Hoen, (The Ocean) and dive around it, you will find Shards.  There are Blue, Red, Green, and Yellow Shards.  Give them to the Shard Hunter in exchange for one of the 4 elemental stones available.Cheat: Battle Tower UnlockablesThe following are the items you can unlock by completing the challenges in the Trick House on Route 110.Cheat: Mirage IslandAn island that appears very rarely. There is a rare Berry and infinite Wynaut inhabiting the island. It does not appear randomly, however. Mirage Island is assigned a number daily. If the number matches a Pokemon in your party's ID number, it will be visible. Thus, your chances of seeing Mirage Island is to have many different ID numbers in your party.</plot>
