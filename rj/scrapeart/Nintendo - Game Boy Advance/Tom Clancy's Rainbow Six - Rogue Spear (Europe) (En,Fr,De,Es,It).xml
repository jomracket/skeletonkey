	<Name>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six - Rogue Spear (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)</Name>
	<plot>Plot:Most of the games single player mission do not tie together,although a few do focus on a plot by a Russian  organized crime boss Maxim Kutkin and international arms dealer Samed Vezirzade.They both manufacture and distribute nuclear weapons on the international black market, aided by Kutkin's acquired ownership of a nuclear power plant following the collapse of the Soviet Union.The game's name "Rogue Spear" refers to refers to the possession of nuclear weapons by a non-state entity.Multiplayer:Rogue Spear's multiplayer was playable on 3 different networks,GameSpy Arcade, MSN Gaming Zone, and Mplayer.com(now intergrated into GameSpy Arcade)The multiplayer game achieved a certain degree of success boasting several thousand players playing at once. After the acquisition of MPlayer.com by GameSpy Arcade, MSN Games became the more popular of the two until Microsoft shut down the MSN Gaming Zone's CD-ROM match-making service on June 19, 2006.Rogue Spear also fetured a ranking system called ladder play. Several websites throughout the game's lifespan provided this service with the four most notable being Clanladder (CL), Xtreme Gaming Network (XGN), Starlance (SL) and International Gaming Syndicate (IGN). While all of these websites provided a ranking system, they also provided anti-cheat applications developed by the staff and community. More notably, SL and IGN both employed anti-cheat squads that would pose as gamers and monitor the playing styles of suspected cheaters.  Their findings would often result in the banning and deletion of offenders from the ladder system.

	<Notes>Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the economic situation in Russia and the former Eastern Europe falls into chaos. Terrorism in the region is commonplace as people fight a seemingly endless stream of battles for supplies and other necessities. In this power vacuum though a dangerous a situation arises: the Russian mafia has begun buying up surplus military equipment with the assistance of current members of the Russian Army. During one such arms deal Rainbow forces raid the meeting grounds and recover weapons grade plutonium, tracing the fissile material to a nearby naval base.</Notes>
