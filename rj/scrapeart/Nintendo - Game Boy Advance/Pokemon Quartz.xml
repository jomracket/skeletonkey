	<Plot>Pokemon Quartz is one of the best Pokemon Hack ROM ever. It is from Baro and was released in 2006. It is also one of the earliest Pokemon Hack ROM in the community. If I have to comment a word about it, I will say “Excellent”. The game is totally completed in gameplay and you can not stop playing it. To make it, you know it takes a lot of time from writing the plot to making minor chages in graphics or sounds. One special thing is that it owns many of Fake Pokemon or Fakemon that were drawn himself. You live in a small town called Saffron in Corna Region and are a young trainer. Professor Baro Lab is near your house. One day, you have to move to the breeze town and Professor wants you and your friend Ran/J.Akira to catch all Pokemon in this region. So your adventure now begins. You will meet a lot of new people, must defeat GYM Leaders, the rivals and earn money to continue your journey. Finally, you realize that you must save your world from the Evil Team.</Plot>
