	<plot>Overview:Madden NFL 07 was the first entry in the Madden NFL franchise to be released on the PlayStation 3 and Wii consoles. The Wii version of the game in particular is notable for introducing a motion-control based gameplay system dubbed "FreeMotion Controls." The cover athlete of the 2007 edition is Shaun Alexander, then a running back for the Seattle Seahawks.FreeMotion ControlsThe Wii version's FreeMotion control system shifted gameplay away from the standard controller-based gameplay that had long-defined Madden. Actions such as passing, kicking and so on are performed via swinging or shaking the Wii Remote in conjunction with the appropriate button press (for example, pressing the button for the intended receiver as the Wii Remote is swung in a passing motion).Other New FeaturesLead Blocker ControlHighlight StickJuking and Spinning (Types of new jukes between controls)Soundtrack:30 Seconds to Mars - "Battle Of One"AFI - "Summer Shudder"Al Fatz - "Came Down"Anti-Flag - "This Is The End (For You My Friend)"Atreyu - "Ex's And Oh's"Audioslave - "Revelations"Bishop Lamont feat.
