The game can also connect through mobile phones to check global rankings, enter local ranking entries, and download ghosts and new courses.In the championship mode, players need to complete the courses in a fixed order while a ranking is kept. The cars are shown from a third-person perspective and there are different AI-controlled racers to beat. Prior to the races, players can do free runs, qualify and eventually start the race or tune the car further. There are two weather types, sunny and rainy, which affects the handling of the cars.There are different cars and courses to choose from, with extensive tuning options based on the gear ratio, steering, brakes, tires, aerodynamic settings and the height handicap. There are also three difficulty levels.</plot>

	<Notes>If realistic racing is your cup of tea, get behind the wheel of the most complete hand-held racer ever. You'll speed through six of Japan's most grueling circuits, blowing past the competition and taking the checkered flag. If the real deal doesn't do it for you, use the game's built-in Track Editor to put together a course that will meet your standards. The All Japan Grand Touring Circuit takes center stage in this detailed extravaganza, as 22 of the Circuits best drivers are the stars here. The vehicles can all be tweaked and upgraded allowing you to truly control your performance and style. Several modes of play make for high replay value and a huge fun factor, while the 32-bit graphics are good enough to pass for those of a home platform game. It's not every day that you get the chance to challenge the world's best GT racers, so you'd better come with your wits sharpened and your seatbelt on.</Notes>
