	<Notes>Sports Illustrated for Kids Baseball will combine extensive player development, player trading, team management and arcade-style play into a unified system of game play. Kids can assemble a team, name their team, choose a team uniform style and then train their players to make them better and advance through the leagues. Plus, two friends can link up their Game Boy Advances for hours of gaming fun - the only baseball game on the GBA that offers multiplayer capabilities!</Notes>
