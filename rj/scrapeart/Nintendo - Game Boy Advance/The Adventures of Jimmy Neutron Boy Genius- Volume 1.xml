	<Plot>Game Boy Advance Video is a format for putting full color, full-motion videos onto Game Boy Advance cartridges. These video cartridges were manufactured by Majesco, except for the Pok√©mon Game Boy Advance Video cartridges, which were published by Nintendo. The cartridges themselves were developed by 4Kids Entertainment's subsidiary 4Kids Technology, Inc. The video cartridges are colored white for easy identification and are sold as Game Boy Advance Video Paks. The Game Boy Advance Video game paks offer the same 240x160 resolution as standard Game Boy Advance games.</Plot>
