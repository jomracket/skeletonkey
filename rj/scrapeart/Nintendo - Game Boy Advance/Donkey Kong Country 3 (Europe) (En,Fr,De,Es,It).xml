	<plot>In a world where ostriches wear tennis shoes and the Kongs clamber through exotic island adventures, KAOS is on the rampage and you must use Dixie's skills to save the day. Dixie and Kiddy Kong take a run through the jungle to rescue Diddy and Donkey Kong! Baron K.

The beloved side-scrollin' sequel to Donkey Kong Country 1 &amp; 2 is now in the palm of your hands! Use Kiddy Kong's and Dixie Kong's unique abilities like the water skip and helicopter spin to go ape on the baddies. A ninth world, Pacifica, has been added to the original eight worlds.

Compete in a series of boat races in Funky's Challenge, use a shield to block an onslaught of spiked creatures in Cranky's Dojo, or race through tunnels collecting stars in Swanky's Dash.
