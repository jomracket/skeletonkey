	<Notes>Yep, there ain't nothing like hookin' a big ol' bass when you're out with the boys putzing around on the waterways. But sometimes, them fishies are just too dang smart for their own dang good -- ya' might as well be eaten, seeing as how you're just a fish and alls your good for is being eaten! But I digress, yup I do. What I'm getting down to here is that there are those times where fishing isn't much fun. But there's a remedy -- can't catch any real fish? Then see how they're biting on a virtual lake. Yep indeedy.</Notes>
