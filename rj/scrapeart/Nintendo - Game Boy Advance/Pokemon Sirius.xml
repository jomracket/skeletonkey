Do you remember its author – the one who just wants to create a super difficult hack version, Unknown Jap (at least that is his nickname)? Well, if you have enjoyed Pokemon Vega before… you will not disappoint about Pokemon Sirius.  This is the first Pokemon hack, prequel to Vega. The game will involve you into a way which your levels are always lower in comparison with the Gym Leaders. At that point, the wild Pokemon’s level is lower than you from 5-10 levels.
