To make things worse, his parents have kicked him out of his house. Fortunately, his Grandmother owns the nearby inn and Keitaro thought this would be the perfect place to live and work as the landlord. Or so he thought. He finds out that the building is no longer an inn and is in fact a girls’ dorm making him the only guy around!
