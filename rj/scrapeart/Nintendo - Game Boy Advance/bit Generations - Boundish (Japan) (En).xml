	<Name>bit Generations - Boundish (Japan) (En)</Name>
	<plot>Boundish is a series of five different two player games, mostly based around the very first video game ever made, Pong. You can choose to play these games either versus a CPU opponent, or head-to-head against another player. Player one is always red, and player two is always blue. The games are:- Pool FlowerTwo players bounce a ball left and right between each other, aiming to get it past the opposing player to score a point. Players can move up and down the entirety of the screen, as well as forward and back about a third of the screen. Circles of varying size float around the screen - if these are hit, they turn the same color as the last player who hit the ball away.- Box JugglingThe odd game out of the bunch - this game is instead based on Nintendo's very first Game &amp; Watch game, Ball. One player walks left and right at the bottom of the screen, keeping a box in the air. If the box hits the ground, it's game over. Pressing A makes the player push the box back in the air - if the player hits the box with their head, it still counts as a hit, but the player is briefly stunned. Power ups and additional boxes appear as the game progresses to keep things different.- Power SliderTwo players stand around the edge of a binocular-shaped field. They bounce a puck between each other, and each time it bounces, it leaves a hole in the playfield. Players can hold the A Button and let it go just as the puck approaches them to perform a power shot. Players hug their circular side of the playfield to take shots at the puck.- Human LeagueThe screen is divided into two sides, and two human-shaped paddles are on each side. The game plays somewhat like doubles tennis, in that if the first player misses the ball, the second player has a chance to recover it. Using Up and Down moves both players (the second player moves more slowly), while Left and Right moves the player closer to the net only. Pressing A while holding Up or Down will make the outer player make a dash for the corner in that direction.- Wild Go RoundThis game has the two players rotating around a vinyl record. The goal is to get the opponent to drop the ball off the record. Each time a player hits the ball, the record rotates, and the label changes color. If the label is the same color as your player, you will score a point. The record's rotation also affects the movement of the ball.http://www.mobygames.com/game/boundish</plot>

	<Notes>bit Generations is a video game franchise for the Game Boy Advance, published by Nintendo. It was first announced under the name Digitylish at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in 2005.[1] Each of the games in the series feature simple controls, gameplay and graphics. All the games were developed by Skip Ltd., except for Digidrive, which was developed by Q-Games. The bit Generations series has only been released in Japan. The games were released in two "series" - the games in Series One were released in Japan on July 13, 2006. Series Two was released on July 27, 2006. However, from June 1, 2006, Nintendo had sent out 700 copies of the games to random Club Nintendo members, encouraging them to preview the games and to post their opinions at the bit Generations official website. In March 2006, some of the games were given an ESRB rating and were labelled under the title Digilux Series.[1] However, Nintendo of America did not announce a release of the series in North America. Stickers depicting the game logos in Super Smash Bros. Brawl indicated that the game series was intended to be released under the title Digilux outside Japan. Some of the games were eventually released under the Art Style banner for the WiiWare and DSiWare services. Boundish is played similar to the Magnavox Odyssey game Tennis and the arcade game Pong, with players hitting an orb back and forth between two paddles. However, each level of the game contains different objectives that require the player to alter the way the orb is battered about.[2]</Notes>
