But after you beat the game, the color switches to purple. You can change it back to blue by pressing Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A at the title screen. Input the same code to change it back to purple.Cheat: Changing the title screenTo do this, you need to beat the game first. Then at any time, press Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A and you'll get to see the credits again.Cheat: card passwordpress R at the password machine and enter password to get cardCheat: Exodia Draw GlitchWhen playing with an Exodia Deck, If your hand contains, for instance, three of the necessary pieces and Graceful Charity, and you activate Graceful Charity, If you get the final two pieces before you have to discard according to Graceful Charity's effect, and you discard Exodia pieces, the animation for an Exodia victory will play, but the match will be considered a Draw.  Weird, huh?Cheat: Exodia Draw GlitchWhen you play this card, normally you destroy your opponent's monster with the highest DEF, but if their monster has 0 DEF, it will actually destroy an empty field zone (Which basically means you wasted it...).Cheat: Exodia Draw GlitchWhen you activate Swords of Revealing light in real life, normally you would flip all face down monsters face up and if they had an effect their effect would still activate. In the video game, when you activate this card, the monsters that are flipped face up and have flip effects are not activated when they should.Cheat: Exodia Draw GlitchNormally this card increases one selected Beast or Beast-Warrior's ATK by its current DEF, but the game actually gives all your Beast and Beast-Warriors their original DEF added to their ATK.Cheat: Tournaments and TrophysThis is just a chart of unlocking the tournaments.Cheat: Tournaments and TrophysTo unlock these characters, you must win the Weekend Tournament, KC Cup, Limitation Tournament, Premiliaries-Challenge, and the National Tournament.Then, go outside your home after a big scenario and go to the Area/Locations choosings.You will notice that the screen goes a little higher than usual.Go to the top of the screen to the new area.It is called "???".You can now duel these rashinal characters.Cheat: Dueling Grandpa Yugi outside the card shopEvery Tuesday, the card shop closes.
