Note* Enemy units can only be controlled for one turn.Cheat: Control Enemy UnitsIf you wish to keep the effects of Nil's/Ninian's rings for more than one turn, have the affected character be rescued.

These Secret Shops sell high-level weapons and even items to promote your characters. Chapter 19 - One is in the clearing between the two broken walls above the room with the two treasure chests in the upper left corner of the map, and the other is behind a wall in the lower-right corner. Chapter 21 - The empty room in the upper-left corner of the map. Chapter 23 - There are two versions of this map. If the boss is Linus, the shop will be on the right side of the map, on the island. Otherwise, it will be in the trees above the lone house slightly left of center. Chapter 29 - In the two-by-two square area left of the lone treasure chest at the bottom-left. You must use a warp staff to get there. Chapter 30 - In the very upper-right corner of the map, among the trees.Cheat: Different Game EndingsIn chapter 18x were there is a magic seal, have a thief steal it from the boss. The silver card will make the prices of items from shops cut in halve. NOTE: Make sure to steal the silver card before you break the magic barrier. You must be playing on Hard difficulty as well.Cheat: Different Game EndingsIn Hector's story, obtain Farina, Florina, and Fiora.  Then, use all of them on the field of battle.  Have two of them WAIT right next to an enemy (on your turn).  Use the third (most powerful out of those three is highly recommended) to attack that enemy.  In the battle sequence, you will see a really cool battle scene and you will do an automatic critical attack.  NOTE:  This will only work with these characters!</plot>
