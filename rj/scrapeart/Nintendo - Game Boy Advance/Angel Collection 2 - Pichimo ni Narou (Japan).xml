Over 300 fashion items appear in the game, helping you hone your fashion skills as you work your way through a story. Also features a make-up studio (the make-up has to match the overall outfit), plenty of random events, the Pichiremon headquarters, an officially licensed representation of the Penty's shop, and multiple endings depending on the player's abilities and choices.
