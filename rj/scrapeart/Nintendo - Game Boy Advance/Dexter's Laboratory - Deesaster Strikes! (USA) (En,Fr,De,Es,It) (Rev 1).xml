It is also covered in flashing lights, and unlocked. One press of a button later, and more than a hundred miniature Dee-Dees swarm over Dexter's laboratory.Deesaster Strikes is an isometric platformer. Explore your laboratory, return the miniature clones to the Clone-a-Matic for recombination, and repair the damage caused by your sister. Be careful, though.
