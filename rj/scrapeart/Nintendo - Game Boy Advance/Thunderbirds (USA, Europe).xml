	<plot>Story:Alan Tracy, son of famed astronaut Jeff Tracy, is awarded access to his family's secret operation: International Rescue. Accompanied by his two best friends: the short but intelligent Fermat, and the telekinetic Tin-Tin, Alan sets on a mission to save the world from perils, flying in International Rescue's high-tech rescue vehicles: The Thunderbirds. However, Alan's brother John is soon put in grave danger by Jeff's arch nemesis, The Hood. And Alan is the only one who can stop him.Gameplay:There are two modes of gameplay for Thunderbirds.Air MissionsThunderbirds 1-4 can be piloted on different missions. Thunderbirds one and two are used for air rescue, Thunderbird 3 travels into space, and Thunderbird 4 is a submersible. The different Thunderbirds are equipped with different artillery used to solve problems and rescue civilians. The Thunderbirds may run low on energy. Thunderbird icons that appear in the game can be collected for extra ship energy. They can also be used to gain extra lives.Ground MissionsDuring the ground missions, Alan and his friends are playable. Each have different abilities. Alan, being the oldest, has the ability to move heavy objects like crates. Tin-Tin is a psychic, and has the ability to contact things from a distance. Fermat, being small, has the ability to roll through vents to access new rooms. Rooms can be opened by operating switches or finding key cards. Thunderbird icons can give extra lives just like in the air missions. However, the characters do not have an energy bar. If any character comes into contact with a dangerous gameplay element, such as falling in a hole or coming into contact with a firewall or a laser blast, a life is lost and the player must restart the room.CameraBoth kinds of missions are overhead. However, air missions are usually viewed at a diagonal view while the camera scrolls through an area. During ground missions, there is no scrolling, and the camera is not diagonal.Passwords:The game is password based, and there are no files. Each level is activated by a three letter password which can bring the player to its corresponding level in the game.Cheat: Passwords for all levels.At the passwords screen:</plot>
