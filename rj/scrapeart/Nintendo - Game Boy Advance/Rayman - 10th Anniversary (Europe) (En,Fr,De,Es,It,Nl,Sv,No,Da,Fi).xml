	<plot>Bundle of Rayman Advance and Rayman 3.In Rayman Advance, the lead character consists of a body, a head, two hands and two feet - no arms or legs. Humorous action-adventure/platformer in which the player must jump and climb, and defeat enemies. In Rayman 3 the lead character has learned some new abilities. His friend Globox has eaten the Lord of the Dark Lums, thereby enraging the Hoodlums.Cheat: Link the Game Boy Advance to the Gamecube version of Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc to unlock ten bonus levels after collecting over 100 Orbs. Cheat: Doing the Ly bonus stages in the 2nd and 4th world will earn you extra multiplayer games.Cheat: Highlight any level on the map screen. Instead of pressing ''A'' to play, enter the code. You should now have all the electoons in that level.   Cheat: Enter these codes at the pause screen.Cheat: When you run out of lives and the Continue screen comes up, enter the code. Now press start to continue (you must have at least 1 continue left for this to work), look at the number near the clock and you'll see that you didn't lose a single continue!Note: Only works when you have three or fewer continues.Cheat: In Candy Chateau Stage 2, Evil Rayman first appears by collecting the spark in front of you when you start. Back off when you begin, than run, jump, and helicopter over the spark. Make sure don't touch it. Now you can make your away through the level without Evil Rayman!Cheat: To unlock the secret world ''Candy Chateau'' Find all electoons in every level. (note: to tell if you have every electoon in each level, the level should turn into a pink smiley face)</plot>
