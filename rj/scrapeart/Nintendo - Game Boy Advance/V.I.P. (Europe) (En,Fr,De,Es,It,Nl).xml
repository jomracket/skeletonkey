	<Notes>Supermodel Pamela Anderson gets another shot at the spotlight in this video game based on Anderson's hit television series. Just like the show, this game has plenty of action, humor, and strategic depth to keep you engaged and, of course, there are also supermodels (if you like that sort of thing). Anderson's character, Vallery, is the star of the game, and you'll help guide the buxom blonde through 30 massive levels of fun and excitement. Vallery being a bodyguard, there are lots of high-profile clients who will enlist her (your) services. You'll have to use martial arts skills, high-tech weaponry, and some of Vallery's signature abilities in order to fend off the bad guys, keep your clientele happy, and make sure the world is safe for everyone.</Notes>
