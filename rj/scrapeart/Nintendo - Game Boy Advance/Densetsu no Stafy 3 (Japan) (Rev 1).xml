	<Notes>A short time after Densetsu no Stafy 2, everything was calm and everyone including Stafy was happy again, until another severe thunderstorm came and shook Pufftop Palace. This time, it is more severe than the ones in the past. A lightning struikes the Magic Jar, destroys it and Ogura is free again.</Notes>
