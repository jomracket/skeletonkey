	<plot>In Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness, you must build a tower from falling puzzle pieces to reach a balloon basket high above. Your tower must be strong and stable, or it will collapse on itself back into the water below. If that wasn't hard enough, you'll have opponents that will do anything to stop you--from throwing bombs and hammers to summoning clouds of lightning. This is a frenetic puzzle game that both young and old gamers can enjoy.Cheat: Unlock SpookTo unlock the character Spook, complete Bomb Mode at Medium DifficultyCheat: Unlock SpookEarn 1,000,000 points in Solo ModeCheat: Unlock SpookSuccessfully complete Egg Mania mode under the hard difficulty setting.

	<Notes>As an Eggo builder, its your job to sort and organise air-dropped puzzle pieces to assemble platforms that gradually form a tower above a steadily rising ocean. Because water quickly seeps up through incomplete floors it is vital that you build complete platforms to slow the rising water. The goal is to reach the balloon that hovers high in the sky, however, to complicate matters, tower-tumbling and thieving enemies prowl the depths and soar the skies, looking for ways to drown your spirit - so work quickly!!</Notes>
