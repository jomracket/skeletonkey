	<Name>Boktai - The Sun Is in Your Hand (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)</Name>
	<plot>Boktai is an action adventure game produced by Hideo Kojima and developed by Konami.In this game, the player takes control of a vampire hunter called Django who fights using a special gun called the Gun Del Sol. The most unique part about this game is that the cartridge has a solar sensor on it. This requires you to let sunlight hit the sensor to charge the Gun Del Sol. The amount of sunlight that hits it determines how fast your gun can recharge. Django has to either be outside or by a window in the game for it to work too. Thankfully, you can store some of the solar energy in various spots throughout the game in case of a rainy day. The time of day also affects the gameplay. In the evening, the game will reflect that by it being gloomy. During the daytime, the sun is bright, especially when the solar sensor is in sight of the sun. Though, it is mostly the internal clock of the game that affects these changes.This feature was also continued in its sequel, Boktai 2.Cheat: Easy Life FruitIn a room in the Abyss, enter the following:Cheat: Infinite Sunlight1. Get a tonniar rm. You can get one from the Count by burning him with a skylight. 2. Observe what time the sun rises in your game (by going into an Immortal dungeon at night), then save in the area with the solar tree 3. Set the time in the main menu ''Options'' screen to one minute before your sunrise (such as 5:59) 4. Hurry and get under the solar tree. At the crack of dawn, dew will fall and convert your tonniar into a Mr. RainNot. 5. Walk east one screen and use Mr. RainNot. You now have two bars of sunlight at all times until the next sundown. Now, to keep your sunlight permanently, each time you play boktai set the clock to daytime of the day you used the Rainnot. With this method you will have sunlight, day or night, every time you play boktai!Cheat: Dark Gun PiecesComplete the following tasks to unlock the 3 pieces for the dark gun (all 3 must be acquired in order to use them)Cheat: Dark Gun PiecesEmblems allow you to open locked doors in Asure Sky Tower.

	<Notes>Boktai: The Sun Is in Your Hand is the first Game Boy Advance game that uses sunlight to influence gameplay. In the game, you'll follow the adventures of Django, a young vampire hunter on a quest to rid the world of evil. As Django, you must overcome traps, defeat enemies, and fight through the deepest parts of dungeons. Watch out for the amount of sunlight--Django is stronger by day, while the vampires are stronger by night. The game features a solar sensor on the cartridge and a real-time clock system.</Notes>
