	<plot>Based on the book series and the feature film, this game tells the tale of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, whose parents perish in a fire. Soon after, they are sent to live with their sinister uncle, Count Olaf, in a cavernous mansion. Now you can help the Baudelaire orphans by using their special skills to journey through 15 missions, from the deep catacombs beneath Olaf's mansion to the gloomy shores of Lake Lachrymose. Collect household items and assemble them into contraptions for puzzle-solving and combat. Wield those items to battle Olaf's minions.Cheat: Unlimited PhotosIn the 2nd level, Count Olaf's house, once you reach the Kitchen, you can rack up photos rather quickly. At the far left is a tall cabinet. Go to the top and jumpright. Continue jumping along the platforms to get about 10-11 photos. Leave the room, come back, and they'll be there again. You can continously do this.Cheat: Unlimited PhotosAlso, after fixing the broken window on the right, you can get 3 photos from thatplatform every time you enter too. That means about 15 photos every time you enter. After about 60 times of collecting photos this way, you can have about 900 or so. It is a little time-taking though, so be patient.Cheat: Unlimited PhotosNOTE: This may be available in other areas.NOTE 2: Instead of exiting via the door and coming back in, you can just switch to Sunny and go in the Cold Storage and exit back to the Kitchen. Thatway is quicker.</plot>
