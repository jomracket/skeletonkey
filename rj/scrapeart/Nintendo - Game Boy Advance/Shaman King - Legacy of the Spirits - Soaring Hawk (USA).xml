	<Name>Shaman King - Legacy of the Spirits - Soaring Hawk (USA)</Name>
	<plot>Ghosts are everywhere. This comes as a simple fact to the Shaman Yoh Asakura, a young boy with the ability to see and talk to the spirits that wander the world. While he would prefer to take things easy, the Shaman King Tournament is coming up, and some of the people who want to become Shaman King really shouldn't be given that kind of power. Assisted by the ghost of a great samurai, it is up to Yoh to make sure the spirit world remains untroubled by becoming the Shaman King.Gameplay: bears a close resemblance to the Pokmon series. Fight troubled spirits, or other Shamans. One spirit can attack at a time, with the ability to switch the attacking spirit out at any time. Shaman King does give you the ability to combine spirits, and some rare spirits can only be acquired in this way.Soaring Hawk differs from Sprinting Wolf in the selection of spirits. While most of the 1000 spirits can be found in both versions, there are some unique spirits that can only be found in one version. You can trade spirits with your friends to complete your collection.Cheat: Hidden Spirit ShacoThere is a hidden spirit in the game named Shaco.  Once you beat the boss, turn the game back on and go to where you first met Amidamaru.  Shaco will send Rio, Trey and Len to different places (Lounge Lizard Lanes, Sunshine Building, and Mata Cemetery, respectively).  Go fight and beat your friends, then go back to Shaco.  You will have to fight him twice, and he is a dark spirit.  Hope this helps all.</plot>
