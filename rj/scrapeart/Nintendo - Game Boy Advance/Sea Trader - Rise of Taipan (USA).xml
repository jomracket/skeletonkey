	<Name>Sea Trader - Rise of Taipan (USA)</Name>
	<plot>"Sea Trader: Rise of Taipan" is a unique commodities trading game for the GameBoy Advance. Set against the backdrop of the 1840's Opium Wars between Britain and China, the player must command a trading ship and sail dangerous seaways across the world in order to find, purchase and sell exotic goods for the best price. The prize: a trading empire dominating the globe. The addictive gameplay of "Sea Trader" hearkens back to classic trading games such as "Taipan" and "Dope Wars", but has much improved graphics and is more action-oriented and engaging.Cheat: AwardsComplete these tasks to earn the following awards:</plot>

	<Notes>Raise your sails and rouse your crew. It's time to discover new lands on the first commodities trading game for GameBoy Advance. Captain your own ship, with a band of wacky sailors at your command. Become the supreme Sea Trader as you trade in silk, grain, currency and black market goods to increase your wealth. Fight off pirates when they try to steal your goods, or even attack other ships to plunder their spoils. And when you're victorious, carousing is optional.</Notes>
