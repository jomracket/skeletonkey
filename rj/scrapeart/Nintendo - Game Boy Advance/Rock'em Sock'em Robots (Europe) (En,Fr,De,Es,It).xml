	<plot>Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots is a handheld fighting game based on the toy line of the same name. It's a one-on-one fighting game where the player takes control of a robot inside a boxing ring and battles against other robots. Each robot has a special move that can be used after filling up a special bar. By combining different button presses the player can unleash a robotic rampage for extra damage against the enemy. It's also possible to do charged punches by holding down the attack button. Once one of the robots has lost all of its health, a concussion mini game is started. Here the player can perform a finishing move by alternately tapping the L and R buttons. Three game modes exists. The classic mode where the player can choose to play as either the Red Rocker or the Blue Bomber is a one-off game. In the versus mode it's possible to choose from some additional robots as well as some different arenas. In the title fight mode, the player starts out with the Red Rocker and then has to unlock the other by winning the fights against them.Cheat: Title Fight PasswordsAt the main menu, go to passwords, and then, using the D-pad, enter the password.</plot>

	<Notes>Over the years, toy fads come and go, but the truly great toys are always popular. This is true of ROCK ‘EM SOCK ‘EM ROBOTS, a game that pits a blue robot against a red robot in a boxing match. DSI Games and Full Fat, recognizing the popularity of the toy, has created a Game Boy Advance version of ROCK ‘EM SOCK ‘EM ROBOTS so players no longer need to have their punching robot handy to go a few rounds. The core concept of ROCK ‘EM SOCK ‘EM ROBOTS transfers over to the GBA with no problem. Players select which of the robots they want to control and get into the ring, punching and blocking their way to victory. Gamers can practice, play a quick fight, or enter a tournament to see if they can claim the title of Rock ‘em Sock ‘em master. The game also features a two player mode using the Game Boy Advance Link, giving players the chance to battle their friends in much the same way they would play with the toy. This is the real joy of ROCK ‘EM SOCK ‘EM ROBOTS because playing against a friend really captures the feel of the classic robot battling game. Players who enjoy playing with the robot boxing toys will love ROCK ‘EM SOCK ‘EM ROBOTS. The toy translates over to the virtual world very well, and the game perfectly captures the classic feel and look of the toys.</Notes>
