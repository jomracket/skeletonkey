Players can choose their character and play chess.Quick PlayThis plays just like tournament mode except players only face one person. Players choose their own character and play a single game of chess against the computer.Puzzle modeThe most complex game mode. The player has to clear the chess board by using his or her wits and different combinations of moves. This is the main part of the game. There are many different levels where the player has to find the correct solution.</plot>
