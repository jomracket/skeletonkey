This game is one of the few games that features tilt control that is possible by a tilt sensor in the GBA cartridge. This allows the player to tilt the game boy and the environment on the screen is affected.Gameplay:Tilting in the gameYoshi Topsy-Turvy has controls like any other platformer. Yoshi can walk and jump, but, with the tilt sensor cartridge, Yoshi can run up vertical walls and he can even slide down hills.
