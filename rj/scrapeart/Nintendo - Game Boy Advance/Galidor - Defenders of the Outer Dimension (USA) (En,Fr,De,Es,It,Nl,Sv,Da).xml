	<Notes>Taking on the role of the hero Nick Bluetooth -- straight out of the hit Fox Kids TV series, GALIDORTM: Defenders of the Outer Dimension -- players find themselves in an Outer Dimension on an action-packed quest to free friends who have fallen into the clutches of the evil tyrant Gorm. With the ultimate goal of finding the portal to GALIDORTM and ridding the Outer Dimension of its wicked ruler, Nick encounters many challenges and menacing creatures along the way. Armed with the awe-inspiring ability to "glinch" or absorb the attributes of enemies he defeats, Nick can fly, jump, grapple and navigate through his adventures.</Notes>
