	<plot>Overview:ChuChu Rocket! is a puzzle game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for Sega Dreamcast, Game Boy Advance and iPhone.The objective of the game is to guide a group of space mice, or Chu Chus, into an escape rocket (hence the name of the game) while avoiding the space cats, or Kapu Kapus. The mice move in straight lines and always turn at right angles when they hit a wall. The player can guide the mice by placing arrow platforms, by pressing one of the four face buttons, to turn the mice into a given direction. All of the mice in a level must be on board the rocket before it takes off, and if a cat, which would follow the arrows just like a mouse would, comes in contact with any mice or the rocket itself, it's game over and the level must be reset.The game was Sega's first online game and became the first popular online game for the Dreamcast. It was later given away free with the console as a demonstration of its online service. It was also was given away free to European console owners, who could order a copy by connecting to the Dreamarena online service.Features:4-Player Battle - The objective is to guide as many mice into you rocket within a time limit.

	<Notes>The object of the game is to guide one or more mice ("ChuChus") around a board into one or more goals while avoiding cats ("KapuKapus") roaming the board. The mice and cats all move in predictable paths by always turning right when hitting a wall head on, by following corners or by turning around when in a dead end. ChuChu Rocket!'s multiplayer mode revolves around up to four players placing arrows on the level at once, trying to direct mice into their own rockets and cats into other players' rockets (any cat that reaches a rocket removes a percentage of the mice within). Each player can only have three arrows on-screen at a time and cannot place them on other players' arrows or their own arrows. Arrows would disappear over time, or could be removed by a player placing his fourth arrow (which would eliminate the first arrow placed, thus leaving three). Although a simple concept, this quickly becomes frenetic with the relentless speed of the mice and four players fighting over them.</Notes>
