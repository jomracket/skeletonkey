In order to defeat it, you must control two heroes in order to solve the puzzles and defeat the enemy characters along the way.Based on the Lego toy series, Bionicle, your task is to defeat the Bahrag. The two characters you control both have their advantages, and you must swap between the two during play in order to get through each of the 6 worlds.Cheat: Throw Fruit You Dont HaveIf you are out of something useful such as exploding fruit, select something you have a lot of (for example, the blue Madu Fruit). Throw a Madu Fruit with L then immediately press R with the item that you want to throw, but are out of. If done correctly, you will throw the item you were out of. However, you will sacrifice Madu Fruit.</plot>

	<Notes>BIONICLE: Matoran Adventures offers a fun character-switching feature to help players advance through each of the six levels found in the game. Players start as a Matoran and unlock more Matoran characters as they progress. Turaga, with their unique powers, can be "picked up" throughout the game to help the player through an elemental hazard like a lava pool or to activate a switch to a secret door. Once found, that "picked-up" Turaga follows you onwards in your adventure.</Notes>
