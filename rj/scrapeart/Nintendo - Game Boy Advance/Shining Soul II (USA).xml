	<plot>Story:Shining Soul II's  action is placed in the Land of Klantol, where the vision of chaos  threatens peace by spawning cohorts of monsters ravaging the land. To make things worse Camille - the princess of Klantol - is kidnapped. Luckily the thing happens during a tournament announced  by her father - King Marcel - so finding a hero able to rescue her from the forces of evil is quite easy. You are that hero. The Dark Dragon was defeated, and Light returned to the land. The four heroes hailed for banishing the Darkness. The People were thankful that peace had returned, and the legend of the Hero of Light was passed down. Buta as time passed and people's lives improved, the legend was forgotten. So, too, dod their gratitude fade, and people began to take Light for granted. In a peace filled town, an old man stood preaching a seditious prophecy...   "Brothers and sisters, look! The crystal is cloudy! According to legend, Darkness was defeated! But, Light will grow out of control, eventually giving rise to Darkness once again. The clouding of the crystal foretells this future. The balance of the world will soon collapse!"The old prophet continued to speak to the passerby, and his voice rang through the town square. But, those who forgotten about the legend took no heed of the prophet's words. Sadly, at that very moment, the end of peace and prosperity was near. As the prophet had warned, the balance between Darkness and Light has been lost. Light had become too strong, and Darkness stirred again. An alchemist, a servant of Darkness, appeared...His name was Gillespie. Gillespie lured the old prophet to the outskirts of town, shattered the crystal that told of the Darkness and robbed the world of one virtuous man. As a member of Dark order known as the Chaos Knights, Gillespie had another mission to complete...And so, he traveled to Klantol Castle...He cunningly befriended the knight Deatharte, whom King Marcel trusted above others, and he gave to Deatharte the "Forbidden Fruit." With that accomplished, Gillespie left those lands. Deatharte was suspicious of Gillespie, and so he did not eat the fruit, until one day...when his curiosity got the better of him...and he tasted the "Forbidden Fruit"..Overview:  World map. Archer character sheet.Shining Soul II  is an RPG                  hack and slash game with a fantasy setting. The game features a wide variety of interesting features such as: 8 different character classes, challenge arena, collectible monster cards, crafting system, charged attack system, 2 difficulty levels, different endings, multiple side quests and a lengthy story that can be played over and over again due to dozens of unique class-specific items to find (each character can equip up to 3 weapons). Just like in almost any other game of the genre when the character levels up it is up to the palyer how to distribute strength, dexterity, intelligence, stamina and skill points. A wise character build is crucial when players want to swiftly move through the quite lengthy campaign that gets gradually touher or try to beat the game at advanced difficulty mode in which monsters get noticeably stronger. The soul items, which can be equipped by every character, may serve as a great aid in defeating stronger enemies. In practice, they are simillar to                     Final Fantasy's                    summons. In almost every moment during the campaign the player can transported to the city, where he can change the gear, browse through his card collection, talk to the NPCs in order to find side quests, fight in the arena for prizes etc. The game also features a multiplayer mode.

Bosses: Goblin Fort:- Captain Gully- Colonel GobovichGiant's Graveyard- Grove GiantWizari's Palace:- WizariFairy Spring:- ClioneRobert's Pirate Ship:- Captain Robert- Giant SquidDriazhek Desert:- Giant Worm- General OswaldKoldazhek Cave:- Yeti king- VaitaliDemon's Tower:- Clone (of palyer's class)- Dark AngelHottazhek Volcano:- Gillespie x2- Holy Guardian of FireChaos Castle:- Gillespie- DeatharteChaos' Domain:- Chaos Cheat: Sound TestWhen the atlus logo appears, quickly press the following:Cheat: Name CodesEnter one of the below as your character's name to start with a bonus. (These only work in the USA-version)Cheat: Duping any itemStep 1 - Drop anything you want to dupe on the bed where you start offStep 2 - Save, and load the fileStep 3 - Pick up all the items that were on the floor at the bedStep 4 - Defeat Chaos and watch credits (long part here)Step 5 - Load file again, you should have all items in your inventory + the same items on the floorCheat: Duping any itemYou are gonna have to have alot of gold for this one, check the glitch for multiplying gold.Cheat: Duping any itemWhen you die, you will unequip an armor, drop it, and drop HALF of your gold in 1 Pile.So, if you have lets say, 500k with you, if you die, that will turn into 250k in 1 Bag!!  Whats the advantage of this you say?  Well, if you can hold more than 100k in each bag, that increases your total you can hold in your bank!  The max in 1 gold pile is 1.25 million, which is made when you have 25 bags of 100k in your inv when you die.  This increases your total from 7.5 million (100,000 per bag * 15 spaces in bank * 5 spaces of 15) in the bank to 93.75 million (1,250,000 per bag * 15 bank spaces * 5 screens)Cheat: Duping any itemThese results are only with 100k of gold.  If you want a HUGE PILE of gold, use a few piles of 1.25 mill, so you could make a pile of 15.625 million gold.  Then 195.3125 million, and so on. READ THE CAUTIONS. Cheat: Duping any item*CAUTION!!!-Having more then 1million in a bag may be dangerous, I am not responsible for erased characters or such.  I'm not sure if it could happen, but I'm not gonna test it, it's up to you from there . If you only have 1999998 in your inv when you die, you will get a pile of 999,999 gold.  That should be safe.Cheat: Duping any item-I'm not sure what happens if you manage to get more than 9,999,999 in the bank, please be careful.Cheat: Duping any itemFirst, have over 100,000 gold in your bank and inventory combined. Next, put any amount of money into your inventory. Finally, grab the money in the bank and drop it on the money in your inventory. Make sure the total will exceed 100,000. When you do this, the bag that had the lowest amount of money will be duplicated. A new bag of money will appear with that amount in it, the bag that was originally in your inventory will have 100,000 gold in it, and the money from your bank will still be in your bank. This will not work if there is a money bag in your first two item slots. Also, whatever is in those slots will be replaced with the money. Cheat: Duping any itemWarning: This trick requires some pretty precise timing, and lots of practice.Cheat: Duping any item1.) Go to your items menu, and place any item into an item slot.Cheat: Duping any item2.) Exit the menu, then hold B to charge up the throw meter for that item.Cheat: Duping any item3.) Press R to bring up the item slots.Cheat: Duping any item4.) Press R again to switch items, and let go of B to throw the item at the same time.Cheat: Duping any itemIf done correctly, you will throw the selected item forward, as well as retaining one in your item slot.  This trick is great for duplicating Yogurt Dolls, and the stat-boosting items (Power Wine, Quick Chicken, Bright Honey, Energy Bread).Cheat: SEGA message balloonSacrifice the S, E, G, and A letters in the Temple of Light to get the SEGA message balloon.</plot>
