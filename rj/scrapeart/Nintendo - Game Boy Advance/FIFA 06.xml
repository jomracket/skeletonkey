	<Plot>FIFA Soccer 06 is the second appearance of the series on the PSP, only half a year after the previous game. It includes most of that game's modes (a cut-down selection of those from the console versions), while updating teams and rosters, revising the controls and adding several new features, including an exclusive mini-game. The game includes teams from 25 leagues from 18 countries, along with assorted teams from the rest of the world and 40 international teams. Game modes include a play now option for friendlies and season and tournament play (each customizable). Challenges, a long-time staple of handheld entries in the series, also return, with 20 comeback and 20 rout challenges from the 2004-2005 season, the completion of which unlocks a custom challenge editor. Infrastructure multiplayer has been added in addition to the returning ad hoc mode. The exclusive mini-game is called juggling. Choosing from one of the included licensed players, the goal is to keep the ball in the air by bouncing it on legs and head. The game is played by holding the PSP sideways so the player is in full view. An icon indicates which of the directional buttons must be pressed while the ball is in the center of the icon. The game is played for high score, with higher playing levels increasing the difficulty. Controls during regular gameplay have been refined. In particular, the First Touch and Freestyle controls are no longer mapped to the directional pad but instead to the analog stick with the shoulder button as modifier.</Plot>
