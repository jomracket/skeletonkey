Some of the classic weaponry is in, the shrink ray and freezer for instance. And in, also, are some old villains too, like the all time fav Pig Cop.Upto 4 GBA's can be linked together for the multiplayer deathmatch mode, but each player has to have his own gamepak.</plot>

	<Notes>Alien scientists have taken control of the top-secret Area 51 military base, and are plotting to overthrow Earth! But not if Duke can stop them. Armed with alien-busting weapons, his kick-butt attitude, and using the aliens' own transporters, Duke takes the battle to four unique locations around the world. Oh, and rescues a few babes along the way.</Notes>
