In their quest to protect the Armor of God, players may choose to play as either Billy or Jenny across seven levels including forest, snowy tundra, desert, and tropical island environments. Along the way they must answer questions from both the Old and New Testaments. Either the New International Version or King James translation may be selected, and three levels of difficulty keep the game accessible for all ages.</Plot>
