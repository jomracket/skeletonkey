	<plot>Overview:Golden Sun LogoGolden Sun (also known as Ougon no Taiyou in Japan) is an RPG developed by Camelot and published by Nintendo for the Gameboy Advance. It was well received thanks to its interesting story, likable cast of characters, varied gameplay, and intriguing puzzles. The game takes place in a land called Weyard, where a group of people called adepts have the power to channel the elements of Earth (Venus ), Fire (Mars), Water (Mercury), and Wind (Jupiter). The game centers around two boys named Isaac and Garet who are attempting to stop two fire Adepts named Saturos and Menardi from lighting the four elemental lighthouses that will change Weyard forever. Along the way they meet a Jupiter Adept named Ivan, and a Mercury Adept named Mia.It was followed by a sequel, Golden Sun: The Lost Age on April 14, 2003, which picks up right where the original Golden Sun left off and let players carry over their character data and items via system link or a password. A third game in the series Golden Sun: Dark Down came out in 2010 for the Nintendo DS.Gameplay:Ragnarok - One of the game's many spellsOne of the most prominent features of the game is its nonstandard take on the RPG mechanic of magic, in this game called Psynergy, which can be used inside of battle to deal damage, buff allies, or inflict various statuses on enemies , but can also be used outside of battle to help solve the game's various puzzles by moving pillars, using gusts of wind to clear away leaves, or even freezing a puddle of water to create a temporary pillar.The game also featured a creature collection mechanic popular in video games at the time. Early on the Djinn, small magical creatures who are tied to the individual elements, are introduced. These Djinn could be obtained by encountering them in the wild, in towns, or in dungeons and more often than not required you to fight them in order to win them over. The Djinn system became the basis for the game's class mechanic as well and is one of the most deceptively deep systems in recent memory.Golden Sun featured an offline versus mode in which two Gameboy Advances were hooked up via link cable where players could use the parties from their own cartridges to battle each other. The game also included a battle arena where you could test your mettle against various enemies using the party you had faced in the main story mode.Story:A Boss BattleThe game starts out in a town called Vale 3 years before the actual adventure. The main characters Isaac and Garet are only kids at this time. A storm has erupted, and a boulder from Mt. Aleph is about to fall down and crush the town. Isaac's father and many other villagers go to stop the boulder. Isaac and Garret are sent to the plaza at the bottom of the village initially to meet up with Jenna, looking for help rescuing Felix, her trapped brother in the river. However, on returning with her, the boulder falls, crushing all the villagers that were trying to stop it, including Isaac's father and Jenna's family. Before Isaac and Garret can reach the Plaza, Saturos and Menardi find them and attack them. Isaac and Garret are left unconscious but are found by their family and taken to the plaza.CharactersThere are five party members you will meet on your journey. All of them can use any Djinni - although all five characters have a natural predisposition to one of the four psynergy types.IvanIsaac is the main character of Golden Sun, he uses a sword and attacks with Earth psynergy.Jenna is a temporary playable character in the earliest part of the game.
