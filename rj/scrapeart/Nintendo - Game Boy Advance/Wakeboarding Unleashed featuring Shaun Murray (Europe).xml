	<Name>Wakeboarding Unleashed featuring Shaun Murray (Europe)</Name>
	<plot>Wakeboarding is the new addition to the Activision line of extreme sports titles.A rider (using a board that's like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the boat itself (hence the sports name).Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way.Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks.</plot>

	<Notes>Wakeboarding Unleashed rips you across a lake by a high-powered speedboat as you perform tricks through dangerous terrain. As one of seven world-class wakeboarders, you'll crash into houseboats and catch huge air in nine exotic levels. If you become too tired, then drive the boat and help your friend pull off challenging technical tricks on the water. Wakeboarding Unleashed takes wakeboarding to the next level with realistic water, unique interaction with the rope, and a fun cooperative mode.</Notes>
