	<Name>Premier Manager 2004-2005 (Europe) (En,Fr,De,It)</Name>
	<plot>Premier Manager 2004 - 2005 is a soccer manager where the player is responsibly for the athletic and financial success of his team. As usual there are a lot of details to take care of, e.g. searching for sponsors, stadium expansion, player transfers, lineup and tactics. But, as usual for English soccer managers, the emphasis is on the athletic aspect.The matches itself use an abstract presentation: The soccer field is shown in a top-down, tactical perspective and the player movements are shown with blue and red balls. It also features a new meeting system where the player needs to convince the management of his views before important decisions.</plot>
