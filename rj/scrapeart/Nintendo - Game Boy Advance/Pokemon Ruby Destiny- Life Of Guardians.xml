	<Plot>Pokemon Ruby Destiny: Life of Guardians is one game of Pokemon Ruby Destiny Hack Series of destinedjagold. It is the third and last game of them which was released in the end of 2008 and still being developed until now. Like I know, destinedjagold updated the latest version for it on June 6th, 2014. Like two previous games, Pokemon Ruby is continued to use as the code base to make this game. I think it is the best project of DJG.
