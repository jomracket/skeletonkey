	<Name>Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)</Name>
	<plot>This compact version of the great and noble game of golf, has the player take control of Tiger himself or other less famous golfers. The player must look out for swing timing and not hook the ball into one of the many bunkers, nor must they underpower the shot or fall short of the fairway. The game of golf is simulated to an accurate level and is both compelling and frustrating, just like the real thing.</plot>

	<Notes>Do you have the patience and discipline to compete with the best golfer in the game? Quite possibly the best athlete ever to compete on the links, Tiger Woods lends his expertise to this detailed GBA experience. Play as Woods or any of 11 other top tour professionals, trying to beat out the competition with a combination of consistency and explosiveness. The setting is the famous TPC Sawgrass Stadium course, and it looks just like its real-life counterpart. Boasting incredible near-3D graphics, TIGER WOODS PGA TOUR GOLF has all of the elements of a real round: wind conditions, plenty of clubs to choose from, realistic hazards, and more. What makes the game even better is the true-to-life physics model, which allows for a thoroughly satisfying outing. Square off a against a field of tough AI opponents, practice a few holes by yourself, or link up and get as many as four virtual golfers chipping and putting.</Notes>
