	<plot>Mario hasn't even had a chance to savor his victory in the original Super Mario Advance, and already he's back for more in Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2.This game is a re-creation of the Super NES classic Super Mario World, featuring every last secret exit and all 74 levels of platform-jumping action.Once again, Princess Peach has been kidnapped by the ever-diabolical Bowser, and Mario and Luigi set out on a massive adventure to rescue her.As either Mario or Luigi, you'll solve puzzles, shoot fireballs, fly, and discover the hidden secrets in Dinosaur Island.Cheat: Get stuck in wallsIn a few levels, there will be sets of rotating blocks blocking your path. (Example: Vanilla Dome 2 or Star World 1)Make sure you have a feather equipped. Use your cape to roate the blocks, then stand in right in front of the blocks while they are rotating. Usually the blocks will just push you back into open when they stop moving. However, sometimes the blocks will push you the opposite direction- into the wall. This usually works only in Vanilla Dome 2, but it allows you to walk down the slope of the wall underneath enemies. However, if you are surround by layer after layer of bricks (Star Road 1), you will be pushed into the other blocks, usually resulting in you losing a life.Cheat: Earn Point Stars (Mario Brothers)For each 150,000 points you get in Mario Brothers, a star will appear at the top of Mario Brothers at the game selection screen (where you pick between Super Mario World and Mario Brothers).
