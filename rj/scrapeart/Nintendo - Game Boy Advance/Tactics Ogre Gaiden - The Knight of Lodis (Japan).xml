	<Name>Tactics Ogre Gaiden - The Knight of Lodis (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis is set in the Ogre Battle universe and takes place in the kingdom of Ovis, which was brutally subjugated by the Holy Lodis Empire. The story follows Alphonse Loeher, a knight of Lodis under the command of Richtor Lasanti, as he is sent into Ovis to investigate military activity in one of the towns.Alphonse's InventoryShortly after arriving in Ovis, Alphonse separates from Richtor's unit during a bandit attack and washes up on a nearby beach. The hero must then search for his comrade with the help of a local knight. As the story unfolds Alphonse learns that there was more to his orders than first met the eye, and he must fight to survive and uncover the conspiracy of the "holy spear".Knights of Lodis was widely praised upon its release in the United States in 2002, receiving good marks from several internet gaming publications, including a 9.1 out of 10 from Gamespot and Gamespot's Gameboy Advance RPG of the Year award for 2002. Unfortunately, the game sold poorly in North America and is now a rare find for gamers seeking to play it.CombatMechanically Tactics Ogre is a traditional strategy-RPG: all battles take place on an isometric chess-like grid map and the player and AI take turns in moving their units along the map.Grid-Based MovementTo initiate combat you move your selected character next to the opponet on the map and select attack, some units however have the ability to attack from distance such as archers or mages. Though simple on the surface Tactics Ogre offers alot in terms of strategy and number-crunching and has a number of mechanics under the skin such as biorhythm, alignment and elemental affinity. The game has a very large selection of units that the player is able to employ including a variety of classes, beasts and hidden characters. To aid the player in combat there is the usual selection of RPG items such as a wide selection of weapons, armours and curative items as well as some unique items for example snapdragon scrolls, which when used turn the character that used them into a unique weapon. Combat is also affected by external factors such as elevation or the weather, for example certain areas of the map can get flooded through excessive rainfall making it difficult to move units.Classes:SoldierThis is the base class in Tactics Ogre, they have no special abilities, no special affinity to any type of weapon and have the weakest stats and stat gains of any class.
