	<Name>Sabre Wulf (USA)</Name>
	<plot>The amulet that had been in place to imprison Sabrewulf has been shattered by the evil Dr. Dolittle-Goode. Now, it is up to Sabreman to traverse the land in pursuit of these villains; and to retrieve the eight pieces of the amulet.The game is separated into two modes of play: the 3D exploration mode and the 2D platforming sections. The 3D exploration mode is how Sabreman gets around the eight different themed worlds of Sabre Wulf. While there are no enemies in this mode, there are plenty of people to talk to, who might help you in your quest. Also strewn about are more than fifty 2D platforming levels, which you can access through the wulf's head tunnels.The point of the 2D levels is to get the Wulf's treasure through a mixture of platforming and puzzle solving. Sabreman can jump, but he can't attack on his own. That is why he'll need to use the abilities of the fifteen different creatures found in the game. The creatures' abilities range from offensive power to getting Sabreman to a higher ledge. Learning when to use these abilities is essential to navigating the Wulf's Lair, and claiming the treasure as your own.</plot>
