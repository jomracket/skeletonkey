	<plot>Klonoa returns in another puzzle-platform game for the Game Boy Advance.  In this sequel, Klonoa is whisked away to a heroes tournament, where he must compete against friends and foes alike for the title of "Greatest Hero".New enemies and puzzles await for players, with Klonoa now able to plant enemies in flower pots, creating a makeshift ladder.  He can also grab hold of electric foes that will rocket him through breakable blocks and enemies.  The side goal of collecting all a stage's Dream Stones returns, and in addition to this, there is also a special 'Sun Stone' hidden in each stage.  Diligent players will be rewarded with bonus tougher levels to complete.In addition to the standard puzzle-like platform stages, there are also fast-paced hoverboard races.  These stages auto-scroll upwards, and have Klonoa facing the top of the screen.  Players need quick reflexes to make it through these tricky stages.  In addition to this, deadly bosses await, in tough left to right auto-scrolling boss stages - you'll have to be quick on your feet to make it to the end...or get crushed by the boss relentlessly chasing you!Cheat: Unlock Dream GalleryThere is actually a purpose to collecting those Sun Fragments in each stage. If you get all of them in a world, an EX level is unlocked for you to play. In order to play the EX Stages, you must beat the game and have every Sun Fragment from every level of the game. Only then will you be able to play the EX stages.Cheat: Easier S-ranksAttaining the vaunted S-rank in each stage hinges on four requirements: acquiring all gems, taking no damage, using no retries, and collecting the sun fragment for each stage.  However, there's a trick to getting around one of these requirements.  If you're stumped or otherwise irreversibly stuck on any particular screen (i.e. a block is where it shouldn't be and can't be recovered) simply leave the screen and come back.  The enemies, blocks and monster pots will be reset to their original position, but it won't count as a retry when your final score is tallied!Cheat: Easier S-ranks(Note: there are a few rooms in the game where you can become physically stuck and unable to leave the room at all, however, these rooms are few and far between.)</plot>
