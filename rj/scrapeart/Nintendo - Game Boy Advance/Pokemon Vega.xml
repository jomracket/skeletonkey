	<Plot>Pokemon Vega: Nearly all members of PokeCommunity have heard about a hack which could be one of the most famous and difficult hack of all time. Do you know what hack is that? Well, noneother than the Pokemon Vega name. Yayyy, another Pokemon FireRed hack is ready to play. A group of Japanese hackers have come together and created this great hack. It contains a new region, many new Pokemon with their moves, a significant challenge for all. Sounds so exciting. At this moment, Pokemon Vega is fully translated into English with a patch. You need to have a clean Pokemon FireRed 1.0 ROM. One thing you should notice: no need to play Pokemon Altair and Sirius because they are lower-quality hacks in comparison with Pokemon Vega. If you still want to play, check the link in PokeCommunity.</Plot>
