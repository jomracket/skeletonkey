	<Notes>The Cabbage Patch Kids recently rescued puppies and are holding a lunch in town square to celebrate their new additions. While the puppies nap in the Babyland Playroom, the kids head to lunch in the square. Upon their return they find that they puppies have wrangled their way loose and escaped! You'll track them down in the park, in town, even at a car wash!
