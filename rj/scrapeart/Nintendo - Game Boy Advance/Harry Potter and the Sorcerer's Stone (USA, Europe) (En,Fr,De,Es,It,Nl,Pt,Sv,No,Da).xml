	<Notes>This Game Boy Advance adventure from 2001 picks up when Harry Potter enters his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, following almost every important detail of the story's exploits. The troll "invasion", the Quiddich match, the earning of House Points...it's all here. The Game Boy Advance version is distinctly different from the Game Boy Color version also released, as this edition is more of a adventure/puzzle game than the Game Boy Color's roleplaying game design.</Notes>
