	<plot>Overview:Ultimate Spider-Man takes the free roaming style of gameplay from the Spider-Man 2 movie adaptation and creates its own unique experience. The game is completely based off of the comics with the same title and continues young Peter Parker's adventures as Spider-Man. Players will encounter villains such as Rhino, Shocker, and Venom through as the game unfolds. The visuals were created along with the artists who worked on the comic series and offers a distinct art style.The Nintendo DS version of the game was a 2.5D platformer that incorporates animated cutscenes with voice acting. This version of the game was well received.Gameplay:Playing as Spider-Man wasn't enough for some gamers so the developers decided it would be a great idea to allow players to play as Venom. While playing as Venom you are able to jump high and do mainly all power attacks. Also as Venom the player is able to absorb enemies by sucking them inside of Venom using his tendrils and recharge his life while draining the victim's. Contrary to playing as Venom, while playing as Spider-Man you are more agile and can do a lot of tricks with your web. The way you swing from building to building is similar to the way you do in Spider-Man 2. You have to swing off of actual buildings unlike the original Spider-Man game.DevelopmentThe storyline and art style for Ultimate Spiderman is based off of the comic book series of the same name. Series writer Brian Michael Bendis provided input into the overarching storyline for the game, as well as all of the original spoken dialogue. Original series artist Mark Bagley designed all of the characters in the game, providing both character models for previously created characters, as well as the designs for all new characters who first appear in Ultimate Spider-Man. The duo eventually adapted and expanded the game's storyline into the ongoing comic series. The story appears in issues 123-128, in a storyline entitled "War of the Symbiotes."Trivia:The game claims that its story would affect the comic book in a major way. However, Silver Sable unmasks Spider-Man in both the comic and the game, and fails to recognize him both times.System RequirementsMinimum:Pentium III 1.2 GHz or Athlon 1.2 GHzWindows 2000/XP 256MB RAM64MB RAM 3D DirectX 9 compatible cardRecommended:Pentium IV 1.4 GHz or AMD equivalentWindows 2000/XP 512MB RAM128MB RAM 3D DirectX 9 compatible cardCheat: SLOW MOTIONPause the game and press the code then resume to the game playCheat: UnlockablesPerform the task in order to unlock the thing specified before it.</plot>

	<Notes>ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN is Activision's third SPIDER-MAN game and the first to be based off the comics rather than the new movies. The GBA game puts players in control of the web-slinging Spider-Man as he does battle with Venom and other enemies while getting help from some familiar superheroes. The story of Spider-Man begins when 15 year old Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider. He soon realizes he has the ability to climb walls and to sense things. Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious black suit that their fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting on the suit, which turns him into the powerful villain known as Venom. Peter must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin, Carnage, and Electro to save the city. In story mode, players can walk around New York City as much as they wish as they accomplish side-missions or move the plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and stopping crimes. He also must stop Venom's plot and defeat the other villains. Players will also enjoy seeing Spider-Man joined by allies like Wolverine and the Human Torch for some scenes. Fans of the comics will enjoy how ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN draws on the comic style and storyline, while movie fans will like getting to see another chapter in the Spider-Man legacy.</Notes>
