	<Plot>Pokemon Order and Chaos is another Pokemon FireRed hack. It is not like the others, but much more different. At first, letâ€™s come to the story. Long long ago, there was a fierce battle between the God Dragon Chaos and the God Dragon Order. Chaos was evil and Order was an angel, they fought for their faith. Finally, Order defeated Chaos. After being sealed for a long time, Chaos is going to wake up again. There is a prophecy: if the land falls to Chaos once more, there will be a 15 years old warrior stand up and prevent him from destroying everything. At this time, the land was separated into two regions: Mandata and Endo. These two have been fighting each other and there will be no stop until that prophecy is mentioned about. The problem here is: there is a couple of twins and they came from these two regions, both of them! There will be only a chosen one, so these two boys have to fight each other to be blessed by Order. Once being the Champion, he will be worshiped as a God to fight Chaos.</Plot>
