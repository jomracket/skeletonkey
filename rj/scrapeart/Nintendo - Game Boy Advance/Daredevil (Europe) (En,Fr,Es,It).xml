	<Name>Daredevil (Europe) (En,Fr,Es,It)</Name>
	<plot>New Yorkers begin to question their superhero's allegiance in a game based on the Daredevil movie. The Kingpin, the city's most notorious crime boss, has told the world that Daredevil is his hired gun--and now Daredevil must set the record straight in a deadly showdown. As Daredevil, you'll zip, swing, and dive from rooftops to sewers. When you're not knocking out villains with the billy club, you'll fight them using Daredevil's boxing and martial arts skills. Although Daredevil is blind, he can still see through walls using his radar-sense skills, explore the interactive world of Hell's Kitchen, and interact with a cast of Marvel characters.</plot>

	<Notes>Daredevil for the Game Boy Advance is your basic punch-kick-jump action platformer featuring Marvel's more unlikely superhero, a blind lawyer with enhanced abilities and senses. Though the game was marketed as a tie-in with the February 14th release of the Daredevil film, the GBA title is more based upon a less realistic, comic book design with bright and vibrant colors and the occasional "Pow!" and "Bif!" when knocking out opponents. Some levels cut across rooftops, others over vehicles in traffic; some go in buildings and underground. As players get through the 23 different levels, they'll uncover the game's original plot through comic book-style cutscenes.</Notes>
