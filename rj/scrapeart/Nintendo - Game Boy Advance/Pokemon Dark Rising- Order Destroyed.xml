	<Plot>Pokémon Dark Rising: Order Destroyed is the next-episode of Pokémon Dark Rising 2 and also the prequel of Pokémon Dark Rising 3. It is a Pokémon hack made from Pokémon FireRed by DarkRisingGirl, a talented female hacker. The whole Pokémon Dark Rising series has a strange game play style. While it is not the same as the others, it requires you one chapter each time you play. Let’s imagine like this: there are some episodes of this game, when you play one episode and finish it… please use the Save State function of your emulator to continue the next episode. Why do I say that? Well, this is a survival-designed hack… which means if you lose, the game is over. That is the meaning of using Save State. Pay your attention while playing and surely you will understand much more about this.</Plot>
