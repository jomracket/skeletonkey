	<Name>Lode Runner (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>You're a highly trained Galactic Commando, deep in enemy territory. Your mission: to recover a fortune in gold, stolen from the Bungeling people by their power-hungry leaders. You'll be running, jumping, and climbing heroically, solving perplexing puzzles. With your laser pistol, you'll drill passageways through stone floors and barriers. To get through this mission alive, you'll need more than fleet feet and good looks. You'll need your quick wits and brains. And more than just a little luck.</plot>
