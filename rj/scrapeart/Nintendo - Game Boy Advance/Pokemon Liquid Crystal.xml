	<Plot>Pokemon Liquid Crystal is a good hack based on Pokemon Fire Red ROM but it is truly a wonderful remake of GBC Pokemon Crystal. This Hack brings Johto Region into your Pokemon Fire Red and you will meet a lot of new Trainers and Rivals. Like you know, the game plot is almost based on Pokemon Crystal plot, which a lot of hackers tried to do. But I am sure it will make you surprised and I think Pokemon Liquid Crystal is worth to try. The story of the game is the same as Pokemon Crystal on GBC with some minor tweaks and the obvious graphical upgrade.</Plot>
