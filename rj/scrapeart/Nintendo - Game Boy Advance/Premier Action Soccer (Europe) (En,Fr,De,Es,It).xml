	<Name>Premier Action Soccer (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)</Name>
	<plot>Premier Action Soccer is a budget priced title based on the FIFA World Cup 2006 held in Germany, released on its opening day. Including all 32 teams participating in the tournament rated in four areas (defense, midfield, attack and overall) with fictional player names (although fans will quickly recognize who T. Brinks and M. Pallack from Germany, Manillas from Spain and Romualdo of Brazil are), players can take part in friendlies, play the World Cup (the real 2006 groups are included, but it's possible to randomize them) or train for penalty shootouts. Gameplay: is simple and straightforward. A and B buttons control kicking the ball (low and high, respectively), being possible to shoot at goal using either one, all depending on distance to goal. After kicking the ball, the player can add aftertouch to the ball tapping the d-pad, making it go away from the goalkeeper of from a defender. The R button allows the player to accelerate, as long as he has enough stamina, shown by white circles under his name. Several tactical options such as formation, strategy and individual orders are included.</plot>
