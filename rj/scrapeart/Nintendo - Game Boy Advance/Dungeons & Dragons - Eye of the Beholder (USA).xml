	<Name>Dungeons & Dragons - Eye of the Beholder (USA)</Name>
	<plot>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Eye of the Beholder is a classic dungeon crawler that challenges the player to lead a party of adventurers on a quest for fame and fortune in a world based on Forgotten Realms, a Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe. The party will scour the dark underbelly of Waterdeep for an evil source of power that threatens the streets above. Nary an hero would dare step into these dungeons alone, so the player must create a party of up to six adventurers from four base classes (Wizard, Rogue, Cleric and Fighter) and seven races (Human, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Moon Elf, Lightfoot Halfling, Rock Gnome and Shield Dwarf). All are based on character types from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition license. The first-person view draws the player into the role of adventurer. A handy auto-map feature helps to navigate the complex mazes of slime-covered walls and hidden passages. For the turn-based battles, the view switches to an isometric overhead perspective. Each character can be assigned commands for moving, attacking and spell-casting. Characters can also learn over 100 unique skills, feats, and spells that are straight out of the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition rules. As with all RPGs, success depends on constantly upgrading equipment, assigning new spells and reordering the group. Over 100 items, both magical and ordinary will keep the player adventuring for hours.</plot>
