	<Plot>Pokémon Flora Sky is an excellent ROM Hack of Pokémon Emerald with a lot of new features. If the original version only has Gen III Pokémon of Hoenn, now you will have Gen IV and V Pokémon which are only in NDS Pokémon Games. The graphics are modified well with vivid colors and beautiful scenes. Everything on NDS now is on GBA game. You are going to have an adventure to a world with a lot of Pokémon Legendaries.
