Developed and published by           Acclaim Entertainment it was originally released for the Xbox, Playstation 2 and Gamecube.  It was developed by          Acclaim's Austin studio (formerly Iguana Entertainment), and was later developed for the         Gameboy Advance by        RFX Interactive. A port for the  PC arrived in 2003 for the European market.Critically, the game was met with average to very average reviews. The main complaints were poor    A.I., a weak storyline, and repetitive game-play. In fact, Electronic Gaming Monthly created the annual Tobias Bruckner Memorial Awards, which honors the worst in video games.              Tobias Bruckner is, of course, dinosaur riding main villain of Turok: Evolution.Plot:The game follows       Tal'Set, a      Native American who is transported to the     Lost Land while fighting Tobias Bruckner. There, he is rescued by Tarkeen, a seer who tells Tal'Set he is the legendary Son of Stone, otherwise known as Turok. From here, Turok must battle his way through the Sleg army to prevent Lord Tyrannus' plan of enslaving the human race.</plot>
