	<Name>Kirby & the Amazing Mirror (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Kirby &amp; The Amazing Mirror is a Game Boy Advance game developed by Flagship Co., Ltd. (with assistance from Dimps Corporation) and published by Nintendo. It is the second Kirby title for the GBA and is somewhat inspired by Flagship's work on the Four Swords game included with the GBA port of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. However while Fours Swords keeps players working closely together, in The Amazing Mirror player are free to separate and conquer challenges independently. Playing without human partners results in the game AI controlling the three other Kirbys, which creates a markedly different experience. Regardless of the number of players engaged, the maze-like Mirror World holds a challenge unique to the series. Flagship would later revisit the Kirby series with Kirby: Squeak Squad on the Nintendo DS .Gameplay:Kirby &amp; The Amazing Mirror is unique from the rest of the series, in the way that it is structured in a way similar to Metroid where the entire game is a large explorable area in which new areas and warps can be established.There is a variety of extras hidden in chests such as maps, sound test tracks, different colors for Kirby, and additional health pieces. These chests are well hidden behind puzzles that require certain abilities. The Master Sword can be used to bypass any puzzle in the game. However, the sword is only accessible after defeating the game's final boss.There is a total of nine areas in the game, each containing a boss who holds a piece of the mirror. When all nine mirror pieces are collected, the mirror will be completed and the final boss can be faced.Enemies:Regular enemiesBang-Bang: Flies towards Kirby with little control, explodes upon impact.Batty: Hangs from a surface and gives chase upon seeing Kirby.Big Waddle Dee: A bigger version of Waddle Dee.Blipper: A fish that can swim in the water, but flops around if it gets to land.Blockin: Disguises himself as a star block and attacks if inhaled.Bomber: Explodes killing all enemies on screen, but only if colliding with a surface or Kirby.Boxin: Tries to punch Kirby while jumping back and forth.Bronto Burt: Flies towards Kirby in a zigzag pattern.Chip: Hops around an a usually predetermined path.Cookin: Throws a frying pan at Kirby, if it hits, Kirby is flipped and cooked on a frying pan.Cupie: Flies through walls and shoots arrows at Kirby.Droppy: Inhales Kirby and steals his ability, turning into whatever enemy Kirby inhaled to get said ability.Flamer: Runs along walls until it notices Kirby, it will then break off the wall and fly towards Kirby.Foley: Stays in a fixed position in the air, if Kirby gets too close, it will fall to the ground and explode upon impact.Giant Rocky: A bigger version of Rocky.Glunk: Stays underwater and fires at Kirby.Golem: Attempts to attack Kirby, gives different abilities depending on its color, and whether it is rolling, punching, or doing nothing.Gordo: Follows a predetermined path and cannot be killed.Haley: Flies through the sky but will not change path if Kirby is spotted.Heavy Knight: A bigger version of Sword Knight.Hot Head: Tries to breathe fire on Kirby.Jack: Stays in cannons, making them unusable, it can be blasted out of a cannon if the fuse is lit though.Laser Ball: Can float through walls and shoot lasers at Kirby.Leap: Flies through the air and kisses Kirby, making him unable to move as he wipes it off.Metal Guardian: Stays in armor until Kirby gets close, will then fire lasers at Kirby.Minny: A very small enemy that just moves around.Mirra: Attaches to a Mirror Door and will burrow into the ground if it spots Kirby, taking the Mirror Door with it.Noddy: Takes a few steps and then lies down.Parasol Shotzo: A Shotzo that flies through the air with its attached Parasol.Pengi: Blasts cold air at Kirby to freeze him.Prank: Will attempt to throw projectiles at Kirby, or paint his face, both of which do damage.

	<Notes>Once again, Kirby must save the kingdom from evil. But this time he'll need some backup. As Kirby, you can call up one of four alter egos for help during your quest. Each character features new copy abilities that range from arrow-shooting to melee moves. Practice your skills in new side games, such as Crackity Hack and Speed Eaters. In addition to new abilities and subgames, Kirby &amp; the Amazing Mirror also introduces new multiplayer modes.</Notes>
