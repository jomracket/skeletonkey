	<Plot>Touhou Puppet Play, or Touhoumon for short, is a spinoff of both Pokemon and Touhou. The metagame has a long history that can be complicated, so we'll keep it simple. 1.5 had ugly sprites, the original type chart, and most fangames in this category just sucked. 1.8 is the new and awesome current variation. It has fresh and new sprites, a completely new type chart with moves, and more. Ask Fatih for any questions.</Plot>
