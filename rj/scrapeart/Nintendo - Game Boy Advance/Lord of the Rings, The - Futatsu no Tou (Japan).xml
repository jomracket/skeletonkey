	<plot>The second chapter in the epic story of Middle-earth pits you against Sauron and the evil forces of Mordor.In The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, you'll battle an army of 10,000 Uruk-Hai on the walls of Helm's Deep, hordes of Orcs on the plains of Rohan, and even the monstrous Cave Troll in Balin's Tomb.Guide Aragorn, Gimli, or Legolas through 13 interactive environments, using each character's unique moves, skills, and weaponry to complete your quest.Cheat: Easy Item ObtainmentThis trick can only be done once you've reached the Fangorn Troll boss fight. Fight the big troll and the little troll, using the health font in the upper right corner if you need to. Once you kill both trolls, they should drop items. Since this is a boss fight, the items tend to be of better quality &amp; more rare than usual. Collect the items, then save. Load up the save to fight the trolls again. Do this as many times as you want/need to get really good stuff. I myself, after many attempts, got the Glamdring "Unique" sword for Gandalf, as well as other good stuff for both Legolas and Aragorn. It's best to do this at a really high level, like 30+ to make the actual fight easier. Having Ent Water also helps. Make sure you are fully healed before saving. Cheat: Easy Item ObtainmentWhenever you find an item that gives negative melee armor (i.e. An item that has -1 melee armor), unequip all other items that add to your melee armor.  Now, with your armor class at 0, equip the item with -1 melee armor. This will cause your armor class to go negative, but instead of being -1, it results in a glitch, giving you over 65,000 armor class.Cheat: Copy ItemsIn multiplayer mode, player A gives item(s) to player B. then player A quits WITHOUT saving. When the screen says the GBA lost connection, player B saves the game and quits. Player A will still have the item and player B will have the copied item.Cheat: Copy ItemsWhile playing as Legolas, hold down the B button until your bow charges.  Then, while holding B, switch to overdraw and charge it by holding A.  After overdraw is charged, release the B button, and then release the A button.  You can now walk with a charged Overdraw.Cheat: Copy ItemsEnter a level with a forge, go to the forge and buy as many things as you can until you have below 30 gems. Exit the forge, then use all your SP and reenter the forge. Try to buy items and continue buying items until you hear a music sequence (it sounds like a &amp;quot;ringtone&amp;quot;).</plot>
