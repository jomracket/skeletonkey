	<Name>Need for Speed - Underground 2 (USA, Europe) (En,Fr,De,It)</Name>
	<plot>Electronic Arts brings back the import-tuning illegal street racing culture back into it's Need For Speed series with Underground 2. Like the original Underground, the sequel focuses more on the underground street racing rather than the series' traditional circuit racing. The biggest addition to Underground 2 is the ability to freely roam around in the game's open-world city. Also, there are newer racing modes like Street X and URL and a much deeper and greater customization option than the original. Underground 2 includes the voice acting talent of various celebrity models like Brooke Burke and Kelly Brook.

Reviews for the game were positive but there was several things that were criticized. Among those were having to drive for to long to get to races, bad voiceacting and strong product placement for companies with no connection to auto racing for example Cingular, which was integrated into the game's messaging system.
