	<Notes>Based on Paramount Pictures' and Nickelodeon Movies' theatrical release, this adventure game offers a humorous look at how farm animals really live when humans are not around. Players start as the new cow on the block and work their way though challenges to prove they are the biggest party animal of all.</Notes>
