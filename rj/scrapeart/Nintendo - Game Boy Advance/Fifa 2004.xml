	<Plot>FIFA Soccer 2004 marks the second appearance on the soccer series on the Game Boy Advance. It is very similar to its immediate predecessor, with many of the same teams, modes and options, but also some new additions. The number of included leagues has been increased to 16, with the Dutch and Portuguese leagues added. The number of teams from the rest of the world has increased to 24, while the number of international teams has decreased to 37. Game modes still include friendlies, two-player link cable play, and several competitions. There is league play for all included leagues, the returning EFA Trophy and European Champions Cup (UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League without license, respectively) and three new additions: Americas Club Championship (pitting North, Central and South American clubs against each other), and International Cup (akin to the real-life World Cup) and a Ladder Tournament. The three new competitions must be unlocked however by connecting to the the GameCube version of the game. Actual gameplay has changed ony little: the same overhead, two-way scrolling perspective is used as are the same controls.</Plot>
