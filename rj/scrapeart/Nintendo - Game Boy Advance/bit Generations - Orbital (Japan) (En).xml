	<Name>bit Generations - Orbital (Japan) (En)</Name>
	<plot>Take control of a small moon and consume all in your path! Orbital is an action game where you pilot a moon in outer space. Your goal is to have the sun orbiting around your small planet. Before you can do that, however, you'll need to become big enough. You can increase the size of your moon by engulfing planets and satellites that are smaller than your own. If you try to run into anything larger than yourself (or the sun), you'll crash and lose a life. Once you've reached a large enough size, the sun will turn yellow, and you'll be able to collect it by navigating close enough to it to snare it in your moon's orbit.Control for Orbital is very simple. By pressing the A Button, you'll attract to the nearest planet. By pressing the B Button, you'll repel away from it. By using a combination of these simple controls, you'll be able to weave in and out of other planets, dodging the dangerous ones and collecting the smaller ones. You can also collect smaller planets around your own as satellites for bonus points. To do this, you must navigate close enough to the planet to attract it, but not run into it. You can also collect the bonus moon that appears in this manner for a special bonus.http://www.mobygames.com/game/orbitalCheat: ExtrasBeating the game by clearing all six regular galaxies unlocks extras on the Galaxy Select screen.</plot>

	<Notes>The game starts with the white star able to take 5 hits before it is destroyed. To make it grow, the player must collide his/her star with a similar-sized, blue star. Stars smaller than the player's star are gray-colored. Colliding with these stars will not change the white star's size, but if the player positions the white star just right, the gray star will orbit the white and become a satellite. Red stars are bigger than the white. The white star is able to orbit red stars to help travel through space. Whenever the white star grows large enough, the target star glows orange, and is able to be a satellite; as soon as that happens, a small crescent star appears, and having it successfully orbit the white star will give the player bonus points, (and collecting all different crescent stars unlocks new galaxies and are the goal to complete the game 100%). Colliding with the orange star will take away a hit, but having it orbit the white star will clear the round. The player guides the star by pressing the A and B buttons on the Wii Remote to utilize gravity and anti-gravity, respectively, and attract it towards or repel against (also respectively) the gravitational wells of celestial objects. Players must be careful not to crash their star into the red stars or floating objects like asteroids, or be sucked into black holes, which takes away a hit (and in the case of black holes, restart the entire stage).</Notes>
