	<Name>Hot Potato! (Europe) (En,Fr,De)</Name>
	<plot>Reminiscent of the original arcade style games, players steer a bus with a group of multicolored spuds on it. As the bus rolls down the streets, players will release waves of spuds down the street ahead of them, and if a potato runs into a potato of the same color, they will save that potato. There's constant screen action as each spud is animated, and waves its arms to attract your attention. The little spuds are cute, displaying a wide range of comical anims and they're literally everywhere. It's up to players to capture the spuds and save the Earth for good!</plot>

	<Notes>Blending droll humor with classic matching-colors gameplay, Hot Potato! is a charming puzzler from BAM! Entertainment (makers of Powerpuff Girls GBC). The not-exactly-fresh backstory has alien spuds loitering in the streets of a quiet burg. You pilot a spud-cleaning vehicle that carries six spuds in two rows. Press A to flip the rows left and right and B to fire a row. If you shoot a spud at another of the same color, both will be eliminated, but if you don't, the spud you just fired will clog up the street until you eliminate it. If you crash into a spud, you'll lose one of your three lives.</Notes>
