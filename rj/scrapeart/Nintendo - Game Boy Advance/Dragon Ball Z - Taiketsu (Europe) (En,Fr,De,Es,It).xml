The current Dragon Ball game features the following options: 1. One Player: Option that allows you to compete as one of the 15 Dragon Ball fighters in the modes available.1. Tournament: You start with 7 fighters but can unlock more to reach a total of 15. All fighters have the same combos and moves (like block, throws, ki blasts, etc.) and a set of 3 unique attacks that do more damage to the opponents. Theres also a combo of buttons that if pressed allows the battle to take place on the air. When on air you cant use any of your current fighters moves but instead you must press rapidly the buttons that appear at the bottom of the screen in order to inflict damage to the opponent. When completing this mode you either get money as a prize or a new character is unlocked.2. Endurance: Mode in which you have to fight a set number of opponents with only one life bar.3.
