	<Notes>The classic comic strip character Garfield is back â€“ just as fat, lazy and lovable as ever! The cynical orange cat loves lasagne, coffee, and his remote control as well as his owner, the long-suffering Jon Arbuckle and the sweet but dumb dog Odie. One evening just before bed time Garfield goes on one of his beloved eating benders. That night he faces the consequences as he endures a night full of strange dreams. These dreams and, in some case, nightmares, take Garfield and the player on 9 unique adventures based on the cat's 9 "lives"!</Notes>
