	<Plot>Pokémon Altair is a hack made from Pokémon Emerald. Well, the author of this hack is a Japanese so its language is Japanese in origin. Its last patch was in 2011, and an English patch was made in June 18, 2014 (just a fan-made one). At first, there is one impression for those who playing this game: it is a VERY HARD Pokémon game. Right from the beginning, you can catch the Pokémon whose levels are lower than you from 5-10. After that, you have to train them and battle with wild trainers and Gym Leaders. Like I have mentioned above, you cannot hope to beat them easily. Good game! Gym leaders in Pokémon Altair is upgraded a lot compared to normal wild trainers.</Plot>
