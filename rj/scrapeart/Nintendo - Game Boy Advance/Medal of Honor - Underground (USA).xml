	<Name>Medal of Honor - Underground (USA)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Medal of Honor: Underground is a World War II first-person shooter released in October 2000 for the PlayStation, and is the first direct sequel to the original Medal of Honor. Both games were developed by DreamWorks Interactive.The player controls Manon Batiste, a French woman who fights for the French Resistance against the Nazis. Manon's role as a resistance fighter leads to a greater focus on stealth gameplay: the player infiltrates enemy compounds, rescues prisoners of war, and sabotages Nazi weapons and equipment. Still, many firefights break out in between sneaking segments.Underground sold very well, earning it a PlayStation Greatest Hits release.A Game Boy Advance version of the game, developed by Rebellion rather than DreamWorks, released in 2002 to poor reception.Levels:Mission 1: Occupied!Level 1: Midnight Rendez-vousLevel 2: Amongst the DeadLevel 3: Without a TraceLevel 4: Tread CarefullyMission 2: Hunting the Desert FoxLevel 1: CasablancaLevel 2: Lighting the TorchLevel 3: Burning SandsLevel 4: Ally in the DesertMission 3: Undercover in CreteLevel 1: Getting the StoryLevel 2: What Lies at KnossosLevel 3: LabyrinthMission 4: Wewelsburg: Dark CamelotLevel 1: Ascent to the CastleLevel 2: ValhallaLevel 3: A Vicious CycleMission 5: Last Rites at Monte CassinoLevel 1: RoundaboutLevel 2: Prisoners of WarLevel 3: Mayhem in the MonasteryMission 6: A Mittlewerk SaboteurLevel 1: Plans for DestructionLevel 2: Sabotage!Level 3: Sidecar ShootoutMission 7: Liberation!Level 1: Final UprisingLevel 2: Street by StreetLevel 3: Operation MarketplaceLevel 4: The End of the Line</plot>
