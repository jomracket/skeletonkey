	<Plot>Many Pokemon games on the Gameboy Advance do not have the Mega Evolution, a strong and very interesting function of Gen VI which can make your Pokemon become stronger and give them some new forms. Pokemon Super FireRed is a hack like that. Its main theme is Mega Evolution, the modern trend of many Pokemon games these days. In this game, our protagonist Red will set out a new adventure in his familiar places. He takes a request from Professor Oak: find and collect all the Mega Evolution forms available in Kanto Region and its neighbors. Since the Mega Evolution has so much attraction, Red cannot stop himself from finding new powers.</Plot>
