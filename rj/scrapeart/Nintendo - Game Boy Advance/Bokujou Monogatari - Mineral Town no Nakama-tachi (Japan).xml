	<Name>Bokujou Monogatari - Mineral Town no Nakama-tachi (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>It's up to you to successfully build and maintain a farm while befriending the people of the town. In Harvest: Moon: Friends of Mineral Town, you can do anything from planting vegetables and raising different animals to marrying the woman of your dreams and starting a family. The game lets you choose which events, minigames, and adventures to complete. Through the Game Boy Advance link cable, you can connect this game with Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life to unlock new events and surprises.Cheat: 50G Curry PowderWhen you're going to buy a Curry Powder in the store, it says it's 100G, but it's actually 50G only!Cheat: 50G Curry PowderThis glitch allows you to walk on top of crops, rocks, and wood, and you normally can not. To do this, you need to have your grown horse and either a sheep or a cow.  Place your cow or sheep next to a crop, small rock, or piece of wood. The object has to be positioned in such a way that you can normally jump over it by running. Next, get on your horse, and go to the side of the crop/rock/wood that is opposite of the sheep or cow.  Lastly, run towards the cow or sheep, and your horse will attempt to jump over the object. But, the horse will stop, and stay on top of the object. You can now walk on top of any crops, rocks, or wood that are next to that piece. When you get off of your horse while on top of an object, you will 'slide' in the opposite direction you were facing until you are in an area normally accessable. If you want to walk on top of the objects again, you have to start over.Cheat: Carters ConfessionalOn Mondays, Wednesdays, and Rainy Days between 1 and 4 PM, Carter will be in the upper-left room and is able to remove cursed tools and accept confessionals. You are given one chance to confess to something. If he forgives you, then you will be encouraged to move on and something will happen. If you are not forgiven, you are merely scolded and nothing else happens. The confessions not mentioned have little or no effect.Cheat: Carters ConfessionalThere are extra kinds of seeds which you can unlock by shipping other produce. Simply ship a total of 100 of each of certain produce to unlock them.Cheat: Carters ConfessionalAll that you need to do to get a blessed tool is to have the correct cursed tool and and follow the directions in the 'How to Unlock' box below.Cheat: Carters ConfessionalBefore being able to find any of the cursed tools you need to have all six of your normal tools upgraded to mystrile.Cheat: Carters ConfessionalOnce all tools are at mystrile level you can then go into the LAKE mine and find the cursed tools.
