	<plot>Hikaru no Go is a Miscellaneous game, developed by KCEJ and published by Konami,which was released in Japan in 2001.Cheat: One-Color IgoAccording to [I]Hikaru no Go[/I] author Hotta Yumi, there is a secret one-color igo mode at level 10, where both players use white (or black?) stones. You must score 3700 points. Play Touya Kouya on a 19x19 board with a 4-stone handicap for Touya, and do not seek Sai's advice. This is the suggestion Konami made to Hotta Yumi. However, she exceeded 3800 on a 9x9 game with a 3-stone handicap.  Konami's response was ''Luck is also important.''</plot>
