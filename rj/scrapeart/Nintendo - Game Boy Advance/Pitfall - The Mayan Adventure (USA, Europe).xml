	<Notes>The Mayan Adventure for Game Boy Advance is a jaw-dropping example of GBA's ability to deliver beautiful graphics. Controlling Pitfall Harry Jr. -- son of the Pitfall Harry from the Atari 2600 game that the SNES game was a sequel to -- you must venture deep into the South American jungle in search of adventure and treasure. Complex puzzles and challenging boss battles become more and more daunting as you progress further into the game's 11 vibrant levels.</Notes>
