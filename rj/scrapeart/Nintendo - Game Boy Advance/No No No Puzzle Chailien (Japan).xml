	<plot>Nonono Puzzle Chairian is a set of three puzzle games in one cartridge, and is developed by Creatures of Pokmon fame.  A group of aliens travelling in space get sucked into a black hole, which makes all of their machines go haywire.  Each puzzle game is based around one of their machines, but has the same basic mechanic - you control a cursor which can rotate a 2x2 square block either clockwise or anti-clockwise.The first (and most well-known) game has you fixing a microwave.  You must shift the food into the holes using the cursor before time runs out, and if you do so, the food is served.  Every five rounds, you get a difficult challenge where there is only a set path to move around.The second game has you guiding a little white blob with legs.  You cannot directly control him, but you can use your cursor to rotate paths in front of him to safely get him to the finish line.  You can also make him run by holding the R Button.The final, and most in-depth game, shows an 8x8 grid of coloured number blocks, from three to six.  Line up three 'threes', and they turn into fours, line up four 'fours', and they turn into fives, line up five 'fives', and they turn into sixes, and line  up six 'sixes', and they disappear.  You can line the blocks up either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.  You can also move other blocks around while numbers are changing to set off massive combos.</plot>
