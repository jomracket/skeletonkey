	<Name>Pokémon Adventures Yellow Chapter</Name>
	<ReleaseDate>2014</ReleaseDate>
	<Plot>Yellow is quite naive, and acts very much like a little child. She hates it when Pokémon are injured, hers or her opponent’s, and has developed a style of battle in which neither her nor her opponent’s Pokémon are hurt unless it is absolutely necessary. Yellow’s special skill, as described by Professor Oak, is Pokémon healing. She received psychic abilities from Viridian Forest, which include the ability to read the emotions of Pokémon and heal their wounds. Yellow is physically small compared to the rest of the characters. Two years ago, Red had a fierce fight with Bruno – one of the Elite Four. Finally, Red was beaten, but his Pikachu managed to escape somehow. When she found it, Yellow also decided to return this Pikachu to its owner – Red. A long journey has begun.</Plot>
