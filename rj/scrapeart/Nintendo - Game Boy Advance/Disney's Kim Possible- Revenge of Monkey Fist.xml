She's not short of high-tech gadgets, either: she can use laser lipstick, compact case bombs, invincibility watches, to name a few. Kim's buddy Wade can also contact her from time to time to provide Kim with useful tips and hints. As you progress through the game, you can unlock pictures by collecting gems which are scattered throughout the levels.
