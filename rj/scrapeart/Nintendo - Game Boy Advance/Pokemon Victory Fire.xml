	<Plot>Pokemon Victory Fire is truly an excellent ROM Hack and supported by thousands of players. It is always in Top Ten of the Best Pokemon ROM Hacks with a lot of downloads. In the latest release 2.3.5, the game storyline is almost finished so you can complete the main storyline well then try doing additional missions. I really love Pokemon Victory Fire and wait for new releases of it with more quests to play. The gameplay is almost the same as other Hacks. You are a boy/girl living in a small town in TYRON Region. You need to travel around all cities and towns to collect 8 GYM Badges then you can challenge in Pokemon League. But your adventure is not simple like that because you will need to destroy TEAM MIRAGE before they can harm other people, steal Pokemon of other trainers and be the new owner of your region. You MUST STOP them!!! Find out more when you play Pokemon Victory Fire. Donâ€™t forget to play after-game missions.</Plot>
