Both Exhibition and Ironman Road feature match kinds such as Gruesome and Deathmatch (inside a electrified cage) with all assorted rule changes included. There's also the ability to play in a four-man Battle Royal.The CAW mode, one of the selling points of the original SNES titles, is as good as ever, allowing to create Wrestlers from scratch, personalizing them from how they look to how they fight, as well as trading them between federations.Cheat: All Wrestlers UnlockedAlright, just go into CAW.
