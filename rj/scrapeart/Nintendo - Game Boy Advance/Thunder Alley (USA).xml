	<plot>Thunder Alley is a racing game for the Game Boy Advance where the player takes control of stock-cars. The game is played from a third person perspective and uses Sennari Interactive's ray tracing engine from Driver 2. The cast of the game are all characters from the Tin Pin Alley series of bowling games. The game features two game modes: Practice Race, which is just the player racing around as he wishes, and Tournament Race, where the player competes against AI-controlled drivers. Throughout the game's tracks, the player will come across power ups that boosts the speed of the player car and obstacles that hinder it like for example oil which causes the car to spin around. There's four different tracks in the game, each with its own layout and appearance, although the difference between them is very small.Cheat: Cheat Code.Go to the title screen and input the code to activate the cheat.</plot>
