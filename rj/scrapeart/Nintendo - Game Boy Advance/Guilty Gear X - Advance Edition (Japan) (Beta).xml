	<Name>Guilty Gear X - Advance Edition (Japan) (Beta)</Name>
	<plot>When the humans created artificial beings named "gears" in 22th century, they didn't expect that their creation will eventually turn against them. Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize: five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner."Guilty Gear X" is a follow up to Guilty Gear, and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 characters available for you to choose. The battle system became more complicated, thanks to the variety of moves you can perform. Beside special attacks which you can execute if you build up your Tension Gauge by attacking or advancing towards your opponent, there is also a variety of defensing moves to perform. The instant kill moves are back from the previous game.http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/guilty-gear-xCheat: Easy way to unlock everythingWhen you come across the screen telling you to ''press Start'' do the following:Cheat: Alternative Way to Unlock DizzyPlay survival mode until you see the ''Dare Devil'' message, you will then fight a golden Dizzy, beat her, and she will appear in the character select section.Cheat: Alternative Way to Unlock DizzyPlay survival mode until you see the ''Dare Devil'' message, you will then fight a golden Testament, beat him, and he will appear in the character select section.Cheat: Alternative Way to Unlock DizzyTo unlock the extra mode for a character, you must beat the golden version of the desired character in the survival mode.
