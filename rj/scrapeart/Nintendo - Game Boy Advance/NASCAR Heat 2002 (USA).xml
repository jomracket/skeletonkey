	<Notes>NASCAR Heat Advance lets players strap themselves into a 750 hp stock car and enjoy all the thrills and spills of NASCAR Winston Cup Series racing anywhere. Whether it's the innovative Beat The Heat challenges or the all-new Career Mode, NASCAR Heat Advance promises to put the pedal to the metal and dust its competition. In fact, NASCAR Heat 2002 is the first NASCAR game for the hand-held system to provide race fans with the ability to see the entire car on the racetrack, not just the back of the car view that has been the only view available until now.</Notes>
