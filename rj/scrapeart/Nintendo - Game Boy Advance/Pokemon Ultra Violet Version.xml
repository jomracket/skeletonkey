	<Plot>Pokemon Ultra Violet Version is a hack of the GameBoy Advance game Pokemon Fire Red Version. This new game has been altered in many ways to make the game more enjoyable, but it still has the same general design and story as the original Nintendo release. Among many other improvements, it has been made so that 1 player with 1 gamesave can play through the entire game and actually catch all of the Pokemon from the first 3 generations.</Plot>
