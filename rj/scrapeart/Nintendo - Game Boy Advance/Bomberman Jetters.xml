	<Plot>Bomberman Jetters is an action RPG that could be considered the spiritual successor to Bomberman Tournament. The Hige Hige Bandits are at it again as they set out to destroy Planet Bomber by crashing an artificial world called Dark Star into it. Bomberman must destroy the four powerful engines of Dark Star before it's too late. On your new adventure, you can switch control between Bomberman and Max and develop Charaboms with special abilities that grow stronger as the Charabom evolves. Up to four players can go head-to-head in multiplayer games, including new minigames.</Plot>
