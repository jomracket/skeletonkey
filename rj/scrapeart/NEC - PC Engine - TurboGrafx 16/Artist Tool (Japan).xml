	<plot>Overview:Artist Tool is a basic art creation program for the PC Engine developed by Hudson. It is operated by a drawing tablet peripheral named the "Illust Booster", which allowed users to draw directly onto the screen with a stylus similar to the art tablets of today, and another peripheral the "Print Booster", which allowed users to print their on-screen creations to paper as well the "Photo Reader" which worked as an image scanner. As well as a basic set of drawing tools, the player could switch between three music tracks to listen to as they worked. The game is a particularly rare and thus valuable HuCard to collectors, due to the number of equally rare and pricey peripherals that were sold along with it. Both the game and the peripherals command high prices on auction sites.</plot>

	<Notes>A unique piece of software for the PC Engine, Artist Tool is a graphics program that allows you to draw and print your own artwork when combined with the 'Illust Booster', 'Print Booster' and 'Photo Reader'. The interface has a rudimentary set of tools to choose from, like freehand, straight line and circle, and also a few tunes to listen to while you draw.</Notes>
