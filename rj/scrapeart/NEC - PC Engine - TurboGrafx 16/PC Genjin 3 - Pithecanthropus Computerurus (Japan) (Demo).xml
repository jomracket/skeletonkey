	<Name>PC Genjin 3 - Pithecanthropus Computerurus (Japan) (Demo)</Name>
	<plot>OVERVIEW:The third in the series offers some significant differences to the gameplay. Firstly, you can now enjoy the game with a friend with 2 player simultaneous play. And secondly, you now have the ability to transform your size to either tiny or huge with coloured sweets that are strewn about the area. The setting has moved on from the primitive era, and you now find yourself adventuring into boats, sewers and houses, complete with giant cakes and mutant babies.COMMENT:The new 'super-size' mode in PC Genjin 3 is certainly impressive, although it adds little to the actual gameplay compared to the tiny mode which is necessary for access to certain areas. By this stage, the series is starting to feel a little tired, but while this is undoubtedly the weakest of the three games, it still reeks of quality, is fun to play and miles better than many other platform games on the system.REVIEWER:http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/PC_Kid_3.htmCheat: Cheat ModeFirst enter the "Cheat Menu" code. Once in the menu, press Select and the game will automatically start with invincibility.</plot>
