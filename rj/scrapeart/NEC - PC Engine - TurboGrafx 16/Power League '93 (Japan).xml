	<Notes>Power League '93 is a baseball game from Hudson Entertainment and is the sixth game in their Power League series, which began as part of the Power Sports franchise, and the seventh game in the series overall - the first Super Famicom game, Super Power League, was released a few months earlier. After Power League '93, Hudson would continue to focus on creating Super Famicom entries. The game includes numerous gameplay tweaks to Power League V's model, retaining the new graphics style. The game is a little more challenging as a result of addressing difficulty balances.</Notes>
