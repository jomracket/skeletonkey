	<Notes>Champion Wrestler is a wrestling game where you have the choice of eight fighters to become champion. You have various moves to use to beat your opponent into submission including kicks, punches and throws. The action is viewed from the side at an elevated angle showing the whole ring. If you leave the ring you have a small time limit to get back into the ring or it's fight over. Up to four players can play and the multi-player options are one player versus the computer, two players fighting each other, two players fighting together against the computer or four players split into two teams fighting each other.</Notes>
