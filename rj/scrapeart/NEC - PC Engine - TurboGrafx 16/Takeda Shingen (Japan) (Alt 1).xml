	<Notes>Takeda Shingen is a 2D beat 'em up set in feudal Japan. The action takes place in Sengoku period. The player takes the role of the daimyō Takeda Shingen, who must defeat his adversary Uesugi Kenshin. Gameplay is typical of the genre, similar to King of Dragons or Knights of the Round. Takeda wields a Japanese sword (katana) and dons red armor. He must proceed from left to right and eliminate all enemies and bosses. Sometimes, the daimyō can visit some shops to buy various items.</Notes>
