	<Name>Legend of Hero Tonma (USA)</Name>
	<plot>A little caped hero called Tommy must fight his way to the boss' castle through a cute world to rescue a princess, but stopping him from his rescue mission will be several enemies, which he has to deal with by launching little fireballs at them. Tommy may also jump on their heads to stun them for a moment.Getting power-ups will make the fireball soon increase to a strange "bouncing" fireball, which will provide more damage to enemies. Treasure chests can be busted open, allowing Tommy to collect coins. Tommy's journey will have him explore ruins, cliffs, statues, dungeons, and finally the castle. At the end of each of these, there is a boss that must be defeated in order to proceed to the next stage.</plot>
