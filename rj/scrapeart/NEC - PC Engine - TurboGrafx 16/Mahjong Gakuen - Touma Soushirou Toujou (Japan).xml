	<plot>Overview:Mahjong Gakuen Touma Soushirou Toujou is a mahjong game for the PC Engine that features pixellated nudity. When playing female opponents, winning subsequent hands of mahjong causes them to undress, similar to strip poker. The game also has male opponents which the player simply beats up instead after every successful game.Touma Soushirou Toujou is the follow-up to the original 1988 Arcade game Mahjong Gakuen. Outcry over its salacious content forced Face to reconfigure the game as Mahjong Gakuen Touma Shoushirou Toujou Mild the subsequent year, which removed the nudity and replaced it with skimpy swimwear.Cheat: Increase ContinuesOn the continue screen (where it shows you the face of a Japanese girl), wait 1 minute and then, starting from Up, do a clockwise motion with the control pad.
