	<plot>Overview:Double Dungeons is a dungeon-crawler for TurboGrafx-16. The player chooses a dungeon and then moves around it, going up experience levels and eventually finding and defeating a boss. Each dungeon requires the same strategy: the player must find and defeat the weak monsters (all monsters, their power and their placement in the dungeon is pre-determined), fight their way to the tougher ones as they grow more powerful and buy better equipment, find the right keys to get to the boss and then eliminate said boss to complete the dungeon. Characters of a much larger password are given out at the end of each dungeon, and the idea is to finish them all for the full password which leads to the final dungeon.The game was released on the US TurboGrafx-16 and Japan PC Engine in 1990. It was eventually added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007.Cheat: In Front of The Last Boss DoorAt the password screen carefully enter the following password:Cheat: In Front of The Last Boss DoorcHR0(zero)EScxgoAqiky7ihO(letter)feBGe</plot>
