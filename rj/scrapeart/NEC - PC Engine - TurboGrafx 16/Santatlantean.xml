	<Plot>Jealous of all the time her husband spends drinking sherry and eating biscuits in other people's houses, Mrs Claus decides the only way to be rid of her overweight husband is to put an evil spell on the Christmas decorations and let them do the dirty work for her. As Santa, you must destroy these festive fiends, but beware; evil baubles are lying in wait, candy canes attack without warning and scented candles are out to burn your beard off! Santatlantean is a festive high-score action shoot 'em up (based on Aetherbyte's Atlantean) which is free to download and play on a PC Engine emulator of your choice (such as Magic Engine, Mednafen or Ootake) or flash card.</Plot>
