	<plot>Overview:Samurai Ghost, sometimes styled as Samurai-Ghost and known as Genpei Touma Den: Kan no Ni ("The Genji and Heike Tale of the Demon's Demise: Volume Two") in Japan, is a side-scrolling brawler and the sequel to the original Genpei Touma Den/The Genji and the Heike Clans. Taira no Kagekiyo is once again compelled to seek out the demonic Genji clan that wiped out his own clan, the Heike, and destroy them. Both Kagekiyo and his enemies have supernatural powers, on top of their considerable martial ability.Samurai Ghost was released in Japan and the US for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1992, though the US did not receive the preceding game The Genji and the Heike Clans until years afterwards. Samurai Ghost was also added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007.Cheat: Cheat MenuAt the title screen, push the following button combination for a cheat menu with options to change lives and levels, and for a sound test:</plot>

	<Notes>This action platformer features a samurai ghost from the depths of the underworld. In a past war, Kagekiyo managed to defeat the shogun Yoritomo and his clan. However, their evil spirits were not completely destroyed, and now, in the world known as Dark Side, they seek the time of their rebirth. In order to shatter those ambitions, Kagekiyo must make his way across seven zones and head for "The Heart of the Darkside" where Yoritomo lies in wait. Use spirit weapons to power up your sword, or other items, such as candles to recover health, and defeat the endless hordes of enemies. Each zone is not only protected by a boss but also includes demons as well as real samurai from 12th-century Japan. Get ready for some intense one-on-one combat action.</Notes>
