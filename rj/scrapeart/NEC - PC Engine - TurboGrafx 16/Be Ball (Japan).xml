	<plot>Be Ball is an action/puzzle game in which you have to roll coloured globes around the play area and deposit them on their relevant coloured squares. Once all balls are in place it's on to the next level. Easy, right? Well, maybe not, as there is all manner of wildlife out to put paid to your spherical antics, from hedgehogs to monkeys and penguins. Luckily, the balls themselves do have a use - give them a swift kick and they'll get rid of any creature barring your way. And if you are persistent, you can even whack down walls. Also, be on the lookout for various items scattered around that aid you in your task, like time-stops, smart bombs etc.COMMENT:First off, I'll promise not to make any crude jokes about cute girls manhandling massive balls. OK? Right.Graphics in Be Ball are pretty nice. Good big, chunky sprites, brightly coloured with nice animation. Levels are maybe a bit repetitive and could have done with a few more touches of variety. Music is cute and OK, but nothing you'll be rushing to record off in a hurry.The game itself is decent. The single screen per level layout can seem a little restrictive, and I think it may have advantaged from larger scrolling maps at times, but I suppose the claustrophobic layout gives a sense of urgency to the gameplay as you have to be very aware of what is following close behind. An advantage is the ability to play with 2 players simultaneously, and there is also a (very) simple kickball game to play, as well as a map editor for those creative designers among you. The puzzle element is pretty minimal as this is mostly an arcade experience and although not as fun as other action puzzlers like Bomber Man and Battle Lode Runner, Be Ball is certainly worth a look..HINTS:- Level select -Enter your password as 677261http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Be_Ball.htm</plot>

	<Notes>Beball is a single-screen action puzzle by Hudson Soft. In ancient China, the evil sorcerer Chumanfu (aka Chew-man-fu) has selfishly taken over the holy tower. An ermite monk sends two of his disciples, the young Rin Rin and Ran Ran, to enter the large tower made out of countless mazes, all filled with monsters and deadly hazards created by the sorcerer's magic powers. The goal of the game is to move four large and colored marbles (red, blue, black and green) onto their respective color pads within a time limit. However, nasty creatures (hedgehogs, tortoises, giant apes and so forth) try to stop our heroines and prevent them to perform their sworn duty. And this is where the ability to kick comes handy - the young monks can strike the colored orbs, sending them flying across the screen and damaging enemies along the way. The same technique can be used to crack and destroy walls from the playfield. From time to time, special icons appear and give the little girls special powers, such as red circles (kill all creatures), clocks (freeze time), bowls of soup (attract creatures), skulls (reduce the girl's life) and so forth. Diamonds can also be collected along the way to unlock bonus stages rewarding the player with extra lives. Be Ball includes a two-player mini-game called KickBall and a level editor where custom stages can be created and stored on any backup Ram units. Be Ball consists of five areas made out of ten stages each and features a password system. Finally, a two simultaneous players mode is also available.</Notes>
