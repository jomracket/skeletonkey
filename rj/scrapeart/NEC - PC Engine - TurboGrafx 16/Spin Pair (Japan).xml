	<Name>Spin Pair (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>This might look like a typical drop-the-block puzzle game, but there's a twist (or spin) to it. Instead of just matching block colours, you also have to fill in the blocks by rotating their 'full' half so it matches the 'empty' half of the shape below. As levels progress, blocks represent different things like plants, animals etc to give some variety. There are several modes of play, including a story mode and link-up.http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Spin_Pair.htmCheat: Level SelectAt the title screen, enter the following button combinations to start on the specified level:</plot>
