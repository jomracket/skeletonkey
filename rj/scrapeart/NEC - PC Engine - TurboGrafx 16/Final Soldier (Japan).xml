	<plot>Overview:Final Soldier is the third game in the Star Soldier series and the second of the core games to be released on the PC Engine platform. It sits between Super Star Soldier and Soldier Blade. Unlike those two games, Final Soldier was never released on the US TurboGrafx-16, but eventually saw an international release in 2007 when it was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in all territories. It has also since been added to the Wii U eShop as well.Among the Star Soldier games, Final Soldier is well-regarded for its weapon customization, allowing players to choose from up to twelve weapon configurations. It also doesn't require that the player restart the stage if they lose a life, unlike other Star Soldiers.Cheat: Arcade Screen ModeAt the title screen, highlight "Normal" mode and press Left, Left, I, Right, Right, II, Up, Down, Up, Down, Left, Left, I, Right, Right, II, Up, Down, Up, Down.
