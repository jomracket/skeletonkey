	<plot>Overview:Takeda Shingen is a side-scrolling brawler released for the Arcade by Jaleco and later converted to the PC Engine by Aicom. It was never localized into English.

Fallen foes drop money which can be spent on upgrades and health recovery items between levels.The game is not to be confused with Takeda Shingen, the 1988 NES strategy-sim from Another and Hot-B which would eventually spawn the sequel Shingen the Ruler. The Arcade version of Takeda Shingen is sometimes referred to as Samurai-Fighter Shingen.Cheat: ContinueAfter losing all your energy, wait for the title screen to appear, hold Down and press I.Cheat: ContinueWhile playing, pause the game and enter the following cheats:</plot>
