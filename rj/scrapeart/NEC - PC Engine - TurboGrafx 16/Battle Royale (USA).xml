	<plot>Overview:Battle Royale is a wrestling game for the TurboGrafx-16, and one of a handful TG16 games to be exclusive to the US. It features fictional wrestlers, and instead of the player selecting their wrestler of choice, they must fight past the other managers in order to select the wrestler of their choice. The player, as their chosen wrestler, then fights the other wrestlers in a ring with the goal to lower their health and then throw them out of the ring, a la "Royal Rumble" rules. The game also has copious "promos", from both wrestlers and rival managers.Released in 1990, Battle Royale was one of the first US-exclusive TG16 games, along with Tricky Kick and TV Sports Football. </plot>

	<Notes>It's wrestling mayhem out of control! Five maniacs hit the mat in a no-holds-barred, free-for-all brawl with no rules, no refs and absolutely no mercy! Team up with friends to nail opponents. Now look out! They're coming after you! Smash 'em, bash 'em and throw 'em over the ropes! The sound is so intense you'll feel every crushing hit, every cracking bone. It's furious, non-stop action for up to five players ... a winner-take-all gang fight for survival!</Notes>
