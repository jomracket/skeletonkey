	<Name>Magical Chase (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Magical Chase is the only game Quest Corporation created for the PC Engine. Quest, for those of you who live in a video game devoid hole, was the company responsible for creating the critically acclaimed Ogre Battle series. Magical Chase is a side-scrolling shooter in which you play a witch on a broomstick. (This concept may sound familiar to Cotton fans)The soundtrack is pretty good, but what's most impressive are the graphics. Colorful and fast moving, the sprites and animations are great, not to mention lots of other special graphical effects. Even more impressive is the multi-plane scrolling. The TG-16 hardware only supports a single background layer. Many games create parallax scrolling in the background by using layers of sprites or modifying the horizontal sync rate of different portions of the background (the latter technique was used extensively on NES to perform "fake" parallax). Magical Chase is commonly accused of doing the impossible (on the TG-16, anyway), so seamless and perfect is the multi-plane scrolling it exhibits.HINTS:- Bonuses -Enter these codes on the difficulty select screenPress Left, Down, RIght, Up, Select three times, Left, Right, I - Get 60,000 gemsLeft, down, right, up, SELECT, SELECT, SELECT, left, right, II - Music testhttp://www.racketboy.com/retro/turbografx-16/2007/07/tg16-pc-engine-games-that-pushed-the-limits-best-graphics-sound.htmlhttp://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Magical_Chase.htmCheat: BonusesEnter these codes on the difficulty select screen</plot>

	<Notes>Ripple is a student of magic, and her teacher is a terrifying witch. Ripple is particularly afraid of her teacher right now, because she's just broken a promise she made to the witch: Ripple took a peek inside the forbidden book Sleeping Demons! No sooner had she opened the cover then out jumped six demons, all of which raced away! Unless she can catch all six demons and get them back inside the book, the witch will turn Ripple into a frog for breaking her promise! So Ripple sets off on her quest with her two Elf-Star friends, Topsy and Turvy. Good luck, Ripple!</Notes>
