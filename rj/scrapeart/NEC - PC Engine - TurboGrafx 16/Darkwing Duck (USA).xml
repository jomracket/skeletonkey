	<plot>Overview:Darkwing Duck, or Disney's Darkwing Duck, is a platformer for the TurboGrafx-16 developed by Interactive Designs and based on the Disney animated TV show. It is distinct from the Capcom platformer of the same name for NES and Game Boy, released around the same time. Darkwing Duck is called into action by S.H.U.S.H. to locate a superweapon being developed by the criminal organization known as F.O.W.L.. Finding the trail involves recovering a missing painting, and DW must visit the hideouts from various villains from the show to recover parts of the painting in the form of jigsaw pieces.The player can take on the first three villains (Megavolt, Professor Moliarty and Tuskernini) in any order, collecting all pieces of the painting in their stages. They must then reassemble the painting before they can take on FOWL's boss Steelbeak for the game's finale.</plot>
