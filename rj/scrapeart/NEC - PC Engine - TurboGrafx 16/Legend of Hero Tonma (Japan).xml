	<Name>Legend of Hero Tonma (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>A little caped hero called Tommy must fight his way to the boss' castle through a cute world to rescue a princess, but stopping him from his rescue mission will be several enemies, which he has to deal with by launching little fireballs at them. Tommy may also jump on their heads to stun them for a moment.Getting power-ups will make the fireball soon increase to a strange "bouncing" fireball, which will provide more damage to enemies. Treasure chests can be busted open, allowing Tommy to collect coins. Tommy's journey will have him explore ruins, cliffs, statues, dungeons, and finally the castle. At the end of each of these, there is a boss that must be defeated in order to proceed to the next stage.</plot>

	<Notes>Legend of Hero Tonma is an action game that puts players in control of the magic-user Tonma, whose role – as was typical for game heroes of the day – is to travel to another world and save the princess. Fight your way through seven stages using Tonma’s jump ability and shot power. Collect power-ups and barriers to grow in strength and pummel your enemies. Bring that strength to the end of each stage to face off against and defeat the menacing bosses that aim to keep you from the princess.</Notes>
