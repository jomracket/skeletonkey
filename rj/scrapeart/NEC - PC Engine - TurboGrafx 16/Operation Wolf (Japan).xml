	<Name>Operation Wolf (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</plot>

	<Notes>Being a one-man army is a difficult business - just ask that bloke Rambo. But you have taken on the hard task of mowing down whole platoons of enemy forces single handed, all to rescue hostages from a rather nasty concentration camp. Choosing from one of four stages, you have a first person view of the action and have to carefully aim your on-screen crosshair to take out the bad guys - but don't get too trigger happy, as there are many civilians and innocents who have chosen just this moment to go for a stroll in the middle of a raging firefight. You have limited ammunition, which can be replenished by shooting the spare clips lying around (which are also dropped from objects such as coconuts and birds), and also a small supply of extra powerful rockets which make short work of armoured vehicles or helicopters that have you in their sights. Occasionally you will see a pile of dynamite that serves as a smart bomb, and a nice energy drink which increases your health slightly - which is essential as it does not recover between levels.
