	<plot>Overview:Night Creatures is an action brawler game developed by Manley &amp; Associates and published by NEC Home Electronics exclusively for the TurboGrafx-16 platform.The player controls an innocent bystander that is suddenly bitten by an enormous bat one night while out on a fog walk. He has increased strength and vitality, but will transform into a hideous monster once the sun rises unless he can defeat Hecate. The game is a standard side-scrolling single-plane 2D brawler, with enemies that can be punched or avoided. Most creatures drop health pick-ups when defeated, but can also swarm the player if they aren't careful. As the player progresses, they'll unlock animal forms to transform into, which aid them in exploration as well as combat.</plot>

	<Notes>Hecate, the Queen of Darkness, has feasted on your blood. Now you must destroy her or be hers forever, one of the Walking Undead. Hecate's bite has given you the power to change into a wolf, a bear, and other animals to battle hordes of monsters and ghouls who protect her. You must search for the one correct route through level after level of unspeakable terror to find her. Choose the most devastating weapons and become the animal best able to fight each fiend. Will you defeat Hecate or become her grotesque slave for eternity? Either way, the Queen of Darkness waits for you!</Notes>
