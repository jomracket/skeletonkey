	<Notes>Sindibad is a cute role playing game by IGS. You guide a warrior who seems to be travelling in the world of the Arabian nights. Ok, that was easy, the game title is Sinbad after all. The game offers an usual top view, where land but also cities and towns are displayed. Then, from now and then, the screens becomes black and change to fighting mode. A picture of your enemies appears for a round based fight. And as usual, they give you gold, experience and items when defeated. Sindibad is your usual Japanese role playing game, influenced like many others by Epix's Dragon Quest series.</Notes>
