	<Name>Knight Rider Special (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Chase HQ style racing game based on the popular '80s TV series.Unlike it's predecessors, Knight Rider Special is a fun game. While driving through the levels, you aren't getting shot at every 2 seconds, until you fight the bosses anyway. The fact that you can spin off the road, get bumped by other cars, and crash into lamp posts makes you have to pay attention to what you're doing. The bosses are a pain in the butt. You're under constant fire from them and there's no meter that shows their energy. Also, you only have one life for the whole game. This can get frustrating, because the bosses will usually kill you once or twice.HINTS:- Sound test -Hold Down + Select and press Run on the title screen.http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/turbo16/review/R51929.htmlhttp://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Knight_Rider_Special.htm</plot>

	<Notes>Knight Rider Special (ナイトライダースペシャル Naito Raidā Supesharu?) is a video game for the PC-Engine based on the 1980s television series Knight Rider. It was produced by and published by Pack-In Video Co. Ltd, who also developed the NES version. on December 16, 1994 in Japan only. The game features sound bites by KITT's voice actor, Akio Nojima, straight from the show's Japanese dub. Unlike the NES version, Special's game play is featured in third person perspective akin to even the most basic driving games like Out Run and Rad Racer. The action is very similar to that of Chase H.Q. which also features a third person driving perspective. Players will have to navigate KITT through and around various cars, big rig trucks, and other obstacles in order to reach their destination and face each level's boss. However many of the cars on the open road are armed with rear guns and will try and fire at KITT. Jet fighters or propeller planes will also fly by and try fire machine guns or drop missiles on KITT.</Notes>
