	<plot>Overview:Tiger Road (JP: Tora e no Michi) is a beat 'em up originally developed by Capcom and published by Romstar for the Arcade platform. The game has been ported to many home computers and consoles. Home computer versions were converted by US Gold for the European market, while the TurboGrafx-16 version (which was released in both Japan and the US) was developed by Advance Communication Company. The Arcade version was later added to Capcom's Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 compilation for PS2.Tiger Road is a Chinese martial arts-inspired brawler that often switches venues to flying stages and other non-traditional action levels, somewhat similar to Battletoads. The protagonist can find new weapons by destroying objects and will switch to them once they are collected, like Ghosts 'n Goblins's Sir Arthur, and the goal of each stage is to find the exit.

	<Notes>This arcade conversion is a beat 'em up in which you (as Lee Wong) must rescue the village children from the evil Ryo Ken Oh. Many levels are horizontally scrolling, although with high ledges to jump onto and follow for a slightly different path. Magic urns containing improved weapons appear frequently. Most enemies are easy to attack and only need one hit to kill, although they come at you in large hordes. Once you get to the indoor sections you will find big enemies with the ability to kill you with one hit, in sections set on multiple levels complete with stairways.</Notes>
