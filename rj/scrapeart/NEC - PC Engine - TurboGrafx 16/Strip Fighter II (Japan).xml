	<Notes>Strip Fighter II is similar to Street Fighter II, but has a distinguishing feature: in this fighting game all the participants are attractive women. Players can choose one of six female characters. The player-controlled character must use her fighting and combat strengths to defeat the other five girls and a palette-swap of herself. The game has some fairly explicit content: during some moves the fighters would take their clothes off; after each fight the player is presented with a picture of female stripper.</Notes>
