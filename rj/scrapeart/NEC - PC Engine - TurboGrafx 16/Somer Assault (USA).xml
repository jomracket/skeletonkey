	<plot>Overview:Somer Assault is an action game from Atlus that was released exclusively to the TurboGrafx-16. The player assumes the role of an unnamed pink tube that moves by flipping over (like a Slinky) and can shoot from its sides. It can shoot in multiple directions, depending on how it is positioned, and is able to climb walls and across ceilings, as well as jump from one surface to another. The goal of each stage is to quickly make it to where the boss of the area resides and then destroy them. Each boss is based on one of the signs of the Zodiac, with twelve stages in all.The game has a few quirks too. The player can enter their birthdate when starting the game, and once they meet the boss that corresponds to their astrological star sign, it will spit out power-ups instead of damaging bullets, effectively becoming a freebie.Cheat: Black and White modeAt the Sound Screen , Press SELECT, UP,Up,DOWN,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT,LEFT,RIGHT,II,I. You'll hear a bizarre screen that flashes the color red, and you can control the brightness and flashing rate by pressing SELECT to switch between the two.</plot>

	<Notes>Somer Assault is a difficult to describe game. In it you control a pink slinky character with guns attached to it. You move around mazes, climbing on walls, on the ceiling, through shortcuts, and attempt to find your way to the end. Along the way, you have to shoot out many, many enemies. And at the end, you will find a nasty boss surprise. The story is bizarre, which fits the concept of the game. A sorceress has plans to rule the world. To do so, she has summoned 12 beasts, each based on a sign of the zodiac. It's up to you, pink slinky, to defeat the 12 astrological signs.</Notes>
