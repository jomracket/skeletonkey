	<Notes>Obviously designed as a game for younger children, you choose between three animal characters to play and must guide them across each level, collecting fruit to feed to the dragon at the end. Gameplay is simple, mostly involving jumping or ducking to avoid enemies - there is no attack. During the level the timer slowly decreases, however levels are quite short so this is to encourage children to keep moving, rather than provide any sort of challenge. Along the way you will encounter doors - some of these contain sliding block puzzles to solve, others have animated pictures of characters that talk to you. Enemies are mostly slow moving, some can be used to reach higher fruit, others are static and require timing to dodge (such as the elephants who lift their trunks for you to pass).</Notes>
