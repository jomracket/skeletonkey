	<plot>Overview:Bravoman (JP: Chouzetsu Rinjin: Bravoman, or "Super Unequaled Human: Bravoman") is a scrolling brawler/platformer for the Arcade and TurboGrafx-16. The player is the eponymous Bravoman, a regular salaryman who becomes Super Sentai-inspired superhero with telescopic limbs thanks to friendly alien Alpha Man. Like Wonder Momo, the game replicates and satirizes tokusatsu tropes.Bravoman was released in the Arcades in 1988 and on the PC Engine in 1990. It was localized for the US TurboGrafx-16 later the same year. The TG16 version of the game was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007. Like a number of other retro Namco properties, the Bravoman license was briefly used for an online webcomic and webtoon by Namo subsidiary ShiftyLook.</plot>

	<Notes>The village of Nitta has been invaded by the army of Dr. Bomb, an evil scientist who is plotting to take over the world. Facing this crisis is Bravoman, who received his powers from Alpha Man to stand up against Dr. Bomb in the name of justice. The village of Nitta consists of 22 stages -- action stages that take place on the ground and shooting stages that take place underwater. Action stages use a unique control system in which the height of a jump and the distance of an attack changes depending on how long players hold down the button. Players collect the Luck Symbols that appear when they defeat enemies and give them to Lottery Man to get recovery and power-up items. Stop Dr. Bomb and bring peace to the village of Nitta and the rest of the world.</Notes>
