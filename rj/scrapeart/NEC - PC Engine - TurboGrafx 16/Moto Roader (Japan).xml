	<plot>The action in this racing game is viewed from above and features rotational controls. There are 6 racetracks featured including real-world ones such as Laguna Seca. Before each race you can buy a full compliment of upgrades and weapons, with each area (engine, handling, turbo and so on) having several variably-priced options). The unusual thing about the racing system is that the action always follows the leader. If you slip too far behind, your car is blown up and placed back onto the track further on in order to keep up (similarly to Micro Machines). This can only happened a limited number of times before it's Game Over.Cheat: CoursesAt the intro, where it shows the cars racing, hold the following buttons:</plot>

	<Notes>Moto Roader is a futuristic racing game that allows up to five players to compete against each other. Players use the cash earned when they win a race to power up their machine. Not only can they change the "tire" and "body" of their vehicles, but they also can add "special" parts. Jump over tall obstacles with a "hopper" and blast past rivals at incredible speeds with "nitro." What multiplayer game would be complete without attack items? Use a forward-launching "grenade" or a backward-dropping "bomber" to blow up and knock away rivals. Outmaneuver rivals in all eight heats to become the champion.</Notes>
