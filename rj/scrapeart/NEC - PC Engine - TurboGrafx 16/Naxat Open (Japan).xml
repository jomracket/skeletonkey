	<Name>Naxat Open (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Naxat's first foray into golf games features a full 18-hole course and lots of top professional opponents. You choose your clubs before starting play, and the game automatically chooses what it feels is the best club for each shot. Before each shot you can view either a fly-by of the course or a close-up of the green and its contours. The game's courses scroll in multiple directions form an overhead view, and feature bunkers, trees, water hazards and all the rest. A three-press control system is used for playing shots, switching to a two-click once you reach the green (as draw and fade become irrelevant).Cheat: Girl PlayWhen starting a new game, instead of picking a predetermined player, choose to enter your own name. At the name entry screen, input "[space][space][space]KO". When you start the game, your character will be a girl.</plot>

	<Notes>Naxat Open is a golf simulator from Naxat Soft. Naxat Soft hired contract developers TOSE to develop the game. Released the same week as Power Golf, Naxat Open aimed for the more serious simulation crowd whereas Power Golf appealed more to those looking for a more casual golfing video game experience. Besides a harsher level of challenge - the acceptable window of error is greatly diminished - Naxat Open plays much like other golf sims for console games: the gameplay chiefly focuses on hitting a power gauge just right to maximize the effect of each swing.</Notes>
