	<plot>Overview:Time Cruise is a pinball game from FACE with a sci-fi theme and multiple tables. Unlike most pinball games with extended play zones, these tables are to the left and right of the core table, and the pinball can switch between them by passing through connecting tunnels. In addition, the player can power up time machines by hitting several levers with the pinball. Entering a time machine takes the pinball to a number of different time zones, each providing a possible score boost or extra ball.Time Cruise was released exclusively on the TurboGrafx-16, putting it up against Compile's Crush series. Its name in Japan is "Time Cruise II".Critical ReceptionWhen the TG-CD version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 5,6,6,5 adding, "...I really like the huge play field. This side-wise scrolling was a rare treat that I hadn't seen before.
