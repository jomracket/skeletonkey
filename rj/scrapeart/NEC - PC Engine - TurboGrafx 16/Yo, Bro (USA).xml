	<Name>Yo, Bro (USA)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Players control Little Bro, a skateboarding, slingshot-wielding bear, as he fights to save California from monsters created by the sinister Dr. Liverhosen. He must defeat every monster on the stage before he can move onto the next, saving as many bystanders as possible along the way and avoiding his canine rival, who is also skateboarding around the level and can only be stunned temporarily with Little Bro's weapons.Several different weapons are available, including various slingshots, grenades, a rocket launcher, and a freeze ray. Players can switch between weapons as they collect new ones. The player can also find bonus stages, which change the gameplay from the usual top-down skateboarding shooter to side-scrolling shoot 'em ups.Cheat: Start Off With a Bang!When the first stage begins, you'll find a building right above you.  Skate up to it &amp; throw a bomb at the door (under the green awning).Once inside, you'll have 30 seconds to grab as many power-ups as possible inside the giant warehouse.Now that you're powered-up, it's time to go take out some baddies!</plot>
