	<Notes>Obocchama Kun is a wacky side scrolling platform game based on a famous japanese manga by Yoshinori Kobayashi and which later became an animation series aired at the end of the 1980s by TV Asahi. The player takes control of a weird kid with strange powers. The greatest being the ability to tranform into all sort of things, from a slow blind man walking with a stick to a four legged and fast dog or a big pink plum. Special items can be collected and trigger even more weird transformations, but also help the player by upgrading the small projectiles he uses to defend himself. Secondary characters can be called during the game. Sort of turtle shells can be found in each area and they can be used to call them (stand on them and sing by pushing up, the nearest item should turn into a special item). They can be in a shape of a beefy dude who will protect our hero, a bearded helicopter shooting down every enemies on screen and a crying kind throwing sorts of hammers in the air.</Notes>
