	<Notes>World Jockey is a horseracing game that is part of the World series of sports games developed by Namco for the PC Engine and the Arcade. Rather than the many simulation-heavy games in the genre, which has players managing every aspect of their stable and jockeys between automated races, the player is actively racing a horse themselves. The game can support up to four simultaneous players at once. There is also a "ticket" mode that allows players to instead bet on the outcome of an automated race.</Notes>
