	<Name>Xybots (USA) (Proto) (Unl)</Name>
	<plot>Join Major Rock Hardy and Captain Ace Gunn in their battle for supremacy against an army of invading Xybots! With a split-screen for one or two players and a unique viewing area, you'll find Xybots a challenging strategic blast-'em-up! It's non-stop action all the way and working together in two-player mode is the ultimate fun. Each player controls one character and the split-screen gives each his own playing area. A map shows the section you're battling through and the positions of the patrolling Xybots. And to keep one step ahead, pick up energy pods, super weapons, keys and coins.</plot>
