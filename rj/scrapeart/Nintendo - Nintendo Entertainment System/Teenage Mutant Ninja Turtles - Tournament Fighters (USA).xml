Each game also have their own unique gameplay mechanic: the SNES version has a Super Meter for powerful super moves, the Genesis version has super moves available at low vitality, and the NES version has a special "ball" power-up for a bonus special move.Tournament Fighters is the last in the franchise to be released in the 1990s (creating a ten-year hiatus ending with the tie-in game to the 2003 animated series). The NES version is also known both as Konami's last game released for that platform and as one of the few fighting games released for that platform.Characters:Each of the three games have different assortments of playable characters with minor overlap.

The turtles decide to enter the tournament in order to stop Shredder and prove their strength in battle.One of the unique features of the SNES version was the different turbo speeds. At the highest setting, this game was faster than Street Fighter II Turbo at the highest setting.Genesis Version Master Splinter is kidnapped by four purple turtles. When the real turtles find out, Krang appears and tells the turtles that he has Splinter with him and that the only way to rescue him is to go to Dimension X and meet Krang. Endings:The endings on the NES version are basically the same for all four of the turtles. The only difference is the portrait of the turtle which the player used to beat the game. In the ending the winning turtle accuses Shredder of being up to one of his lousy tricks. Shredder says that they have not seen the last of him, he then gets up and runs off-screen. Splinter comes floating into the screen, drops down in front of the turtle and says "You have performed well my sons. Now let us celebrate our victory."Endings (SNES)CharacterEnding RaphaelRaphael gives his thanks to Splinter and April by giving them a pile of gifts. Raphael then tells them he is happy to have friends as good as they are. MichelangeloMichelangelo decides to take a vacation in the Bahamas to do some surfing, then invites the other turtles to come along. LeonardoLeonardo says his daily training has paid off, and now he must set new goals and set out to achieve those goals. Leonardo then goes right back into his training. DonatelloDonatello goes back to working on his latest invention which then blows up. He then says he might have some money left over to start a new invention. AskaAska is happy to be able to finally realize her dream of teaching younger people in the ways of Ninjitsu. She then exclaims she will have the best dojo in the entire world. ShredderShredder says he knew he would win the tournament and that he has defeated the turtles for the last time. He now has his sights set on conquering Earth. WarWar exclaims that he won and that has shown the other fighters not to mess with an intergalactic life form. ArmaggonArmaggon exclaims that it is only natural that he won the tournament and that he is the strongest living being on the planet and must now conquer it. WingnutWingnut only entered the tournament to pound some heads. He pounded everyone else and ended up winning and now will be able to waste even more money. Chrome DomeChrome Dome now has the money to purchase the necessary computers in order to extract his faulty program. He will finally be able to exist in peace. Critical ReceptionElectronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version review scores of 9,8,9 and 9 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, "This has got to be one of the best fighting games next to Street Fighter 2, (and in some cases better than SF2). The voices are crisp and clear, plus the control is absolutely wonderful! Another factor that I truly like is the story mode set up with dialog boxes unraveling the whole plot! There are plenty of combos that will get you going! Another great hit from the pros at Konami".Cheat: Player 2 Match SkipDuring Story or Vs. CPU modes, the second player can skip to to the Vs. Player mode's player selection screen by pressing Start on their controller. This will not work during Story Mode's Bonus Game, however; to make it work during this section, you must press Up, A, and B together on Controller 2.Cheat: Play as Hothead agaisnt HotheadNormally, the game doesn't allow more than one player (most likely due to a glitch in the programming), but there's actually a way to bypass this in 1P vs. CPU mode. In the Player Select screen, choose to play as any character (1P) EXCEPT Hothead. Next, the game will ask you to select your opponent (CPU) and here is where you choose Hothead. Now play the game normally, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose.  When the match is over, go for a rematch. This time, choose Hothead to be your character. The game will once again ask you for your opponent, but look and behold! The CPU cursor is already on Hothead. Choose him and enjoy the forbidden battle (unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to do this with a 2nd player).</plot>

	<Notes>Trash the surf board and heave the 'za. It's a whole new breed of Turtles and they're fixated on fighting. We're dead serious, Tournament Fighters takes dude-on-dude demolition to new heights of intensity with 4 modes of pain-producing battles, deadly warriors, secret arenas, astounding graphics and sound effects that'll make you cringe! Clash with Krang-created clones of the Turtles, Casey Jones, April O'Neil, Ray Filet and Sisyphus, plus bosses Triceraton, Krang's Android and Karai. There's flying body presses, knee drops, head butts, rocket punches, elbow smashes, somersault throws, you'll feel and inflict them all. And the settings include Magma Ocean Planet, Jungle Planet, and every other bizarre corner of Dimension X!</Notes>
