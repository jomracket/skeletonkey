	<Plot>In War, you play as a soldier attacking many enemies on one stage. You use left and right to move, down to pick up power-ups, A to throw a knife (only goes a certain distance to hit the basic enemies) and B to throw a bomb which hits the higher/hiding enemies. You only have a limited number of bombs to use however. All the enemies shoot at you and you must dodge the bullets. The power-ups are invincibility, an extra life and extra bombs. You start on one of four different stages, New Junk City from Earthworm Jim 3, Reptile Rumble from Donkey Kong Country 4, and two stages (parking lot and bar) from Final Fight 3.</Plot>
