	<Name>Street Gangs (Europe)</Name>
	<plot>Panic in River City!"To the citizens of River City: I hold your high school captive! With my gangs of students and vicious bosses roaming the streets, nobody can stop me now. Meet my demands - or else!"Slick, the meanest, most powerful gang lord in River City, has issued this ultimatum - and the entire town is powerless in a grip of fear!Fortunately, Alex and Ryan weren't in school the day Slick took it over. But now, their fellow students are prisoners - including Ryan's girlfriend! It's up to our two young heroes to battle their way past several dangerous city gangs, then defeat the gang lord to free the students of River City High and restore peace to the panic-stricken populace!--From the NES River City Ransom instruction manual.Overview::Street Gangs is a pretty fun game. I liked the mix between fighter and adventure. You can go into stores and talk to people to buy food, and books that will teach your charecter new techniques. The graphics on River City Ransom were pretty good too. The people were a little unproportional, but they still looked good. There are also a lot of weapons to pick up and fight with. You can also throw the weapon at the attacker. Street Gangs is a very fun game and I think everyone should try it at least once. Directions:Save River City and Ryan's girlfriend from Slick.Controls:A Button: Punch/Use weaponB Button: Kick/Throw weaponStart Button: PauseSelect Button: Life Bar/Cash amountHints:Faster AttackIf you want to be able to kick, punch, or use a weapon faster, then buy books at the bookstore. Use them, and you will acquire the technique. You will need to buy a book for every technique. Reviewer: Adrianhttp://consoleclassix.com/nes/river_city_ransom.htmlCheat: Dont lose half your money when you die. (2 players only)In a 2 player game, when one player is running low on health have the other first leave the screen. Then have the player in need of health kill their own character. When the low health player dies, as long as the other character is out of the screen waiting to go to the next area, he will retain all his money. If there are no holes to jump in or the enemies are taking to long to defeat the character, it might be preferable to have both characters go near the edge of the screen and have your teammate beat you up till you are defeated then immediately run out of the screen.Cheat: Kunio and Rikis Hidden Portraits (USA Version)Start the game in Normal mode and enter the Status screen. Once in the status screen, hold Left on Controller 2 and press Right + Select on Controller 1. If done right, you'll arrive at a screen with a portrait for Kunio and Riki while the Double Dragon theme plays in the background.Cheat: Change Character NamesOn the character select screen, press Select on the controller to go to a screen where you can change Alex and Ryan's names to whatever you want.</plot>
