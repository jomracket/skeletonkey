	<plot>Overview:Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released in 1991 as an Arcade game and later ported to many home consoles, the game had the player(s) shoot their way through Skynet's arsenal of robot armies and advanced weaponry as an on-rails first-person shooter. The Arcade cabinet included a firearm controller, though home versions would not include a gun controller.The home versions were released as T2: The Arcade Game (sometimes Terminator 2: The Arcade Game). This version was released on the Amiga, SNES, Game Boy, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear, each with varying levels of graphical fidelity to the original Arcade game but all of which largely play the same.Neither the Arcade game nor its home ports are to be confused with the side-scroller action game Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which had separate developer teams and played entirely differently.</plot>
