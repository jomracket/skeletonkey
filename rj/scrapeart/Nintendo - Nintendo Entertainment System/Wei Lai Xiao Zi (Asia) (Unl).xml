	<plot>Returning from three centuries of intergalactic missions, MCS-920 is surprised by an alien-infested planet. Whatever few lifeforms survived were driven underground or transformed into battling bionic mutants.

From barren landscapes and colorful coral reefs to abandoned and frozen cities, you will yet come face to face with the alien tyrant in each world!</plot>
