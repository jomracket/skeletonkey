	<Plot>Thwaite is an NES homebrew game similar to Missile Command. In Thwaite, you have to defend the town by shooting your own missiles from the silos to explode in front of enemy missiles, much like in Missile Command. At the bottom of the screen are 10 houses and two missile silos. Missiles come in from the top of the screen toward the 12 targets at various angles, followed by about 32 pixels of smoke drawn as sprites. Occasionally (more often at higher difficulty levels), a MIRV (large missile) enters that turns into three small missiles when it reaches about halfway down the screen. Sometimes an upsidaisium balloon carrying a box will float in from the side, and once it has crossed part of the screen, the small missiles fall out of the box like with a MIRV, and the balloon floats away. If one of them lands on a house or silo, the missile and target are destroyed.</Plot>
