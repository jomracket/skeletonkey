	<Notes>Vegas Connection: Casino kara Ai o Komete is a 1989 Nintendo Family Computer video game that was released exclusively in Japan. The player-controlled character Roberto is staying in Las Vegas with his girlfriend Marian in a motel room on a romantic vacation. He is summoned to the motel clerk to pay his hotel bill only to discover that Marian was apparently kidnapped by a mysterious person under the employment of Akiko. He must then solve the mystery. Roberto must be able to pay the $800,000 in ransom money for the location of his girlfriend to be revealed. Key people show up in the adventure component of the game and give out advice whenever he makes a notable amount of money at blackjack. The first informant shows up after increasing Roberto's bankroll to $5,000 and the final informant appears once Roberto has $100,000 in his pocketbook.</Notes>
