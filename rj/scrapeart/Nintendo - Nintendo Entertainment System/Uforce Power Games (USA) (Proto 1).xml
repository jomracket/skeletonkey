The player had to defend a spaceship from mutant space rats. (Speculation: 3D whack-a-mole?)- Rock on Air was a rock band simulation featuring a music synthesizer. Hand movements were translated into sounds to compose songs.- Hose 'Em Down was a comedy fire-fighting game. Described as Keystone Cops with firefighters. The goal was to rescue people from burning buildings with a focus on disparate jumpers. If any civilians in distress did not want to jump, the player could convince them with a high powered water cannon."</plot>
