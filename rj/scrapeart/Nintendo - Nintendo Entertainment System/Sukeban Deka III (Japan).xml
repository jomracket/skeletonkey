	<Name>Sukeban Deka III (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Sukeban Deka III is based on the Sukeban Deka manga and anime license. Specifically, it is based on the third TV series (hence the "III", as this game is not the sequel to anything), which involves three sisters taking up the mantle of the Sukeban Deka (Female Delinquent Cop) and fighting crime.The player can switch between the three sisters at any time, and is automatically prompted to do so should they ever lose a life. Each fights with a different weapon: The eldest, and default, sister Yuka fights with metallic origami cranes; the middle sister, Yuma, fights with yarn needles; and the youngest, Yui, fights with the Sukeban Deka's trademark steel yo-yo.</plot>
