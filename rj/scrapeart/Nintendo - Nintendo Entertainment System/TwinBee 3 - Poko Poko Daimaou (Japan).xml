	<Name>TwinBee 3 - Poko Poko Daimaou (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Third game in the Twinbee series of vertically-scrolling surreal cute 'em ups. Once again you take the role of either Twinbee or Winbee (Gwinbee having been kidnapped by the final boss) as they fly through the fantasy kingdom shooting the hell out of their... uhm... enemies, or whatever they are.As in other games in the series you can gain power-ups after defeating certain amounts of enemies by shooting the magical bells they leave behind, depending on the amount of times you shoot them, they change color and thus give different power-ups such as multiple shots, options, etc.If correctly powered-up both ships can join-up to perform a screen-clearing attack, and you can choose your starting stage from any of the first four stages (the fifth and last remaining locked until you clear all the others).Cheat: Sound TestAt the title screen when holding Up and Left on Controller 2, select Options to access the Sound Test.</plot>
