	<plot>Don't let the first mountain fool you, its slopes are rather similar and uninspired, but keep in mind this is the beginners' hill. The other mountains are vastly different with slopes containing half-pipes, huge gaps, cliffs, lakes, chateaus and even highways.Learning how to pass each obstacle will keep you busy for quite a while. The variety of levels is one of this game's shining aspects. My only complaint here is that you must do specific tricks in a certain order on the half-pipes or you lose a life.Hints:Begin with 99 LivesHold Left, A, B and press Start on the title screen.Level SelectHold Left, A, B and press Start on the title screen, then press Right + A when you see the mountain on the screenReviewer: JacketStarhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/review/R55367.html</plot>
