	<Name>Strider Hiryu (Japan) (Proto)</Name>
	<plot>Strider is a platform game where Hiryu must fight his way past enemies and uncover keys, characters and data disks (which can be analysed aboard the Blue Dragon) to find out what's going on. His primary weapon is his jumping ability and sword, the Cypher, which he uses to strike with great speed. At some point in the game, the Cypher may be modified to shoot plasma arrows. Hiryu also has a various set of "skills" which he learns as he gains levels. Examples of skills are a healing ability (Medical), a jumping ability (Jump), some additional attacks (Spark, Fire, Sp-Ball) and the ability to leave an area (Warp).</plot>
