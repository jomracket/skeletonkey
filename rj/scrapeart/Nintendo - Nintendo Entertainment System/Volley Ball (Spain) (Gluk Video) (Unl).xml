	<Name>Volley Ball (Spain) (Gluk Video) (Unl)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Volleyball is a simulation of the real-life sport, in which two teams have to use their hands to knock a ball over a high net without letting it drop on their side. It follows such single-word Nintendo sports games like Golf and Soccer.It is notable beyond being a Nintendo sport sim for two reasons: It was one of the earliest games for the Famicom Disk System - the fourth to be released for the peripheral - and sits between two of the biggest FDS releases: Super Mario Bros 2 and Metroid. The other notable element is that it was co-developed by Pax Softnica, which would go on to help develop many Nintendo games in a second-party role, notably the Mother series.</plot>
