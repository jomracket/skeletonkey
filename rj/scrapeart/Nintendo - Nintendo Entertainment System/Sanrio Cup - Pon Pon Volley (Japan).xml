	<Name>Sanrio Cup - Pon Pon Volley (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>This is a great game. As the name implies, it's a volley ball game with Sanrio characters. Which instantly makes it fun. You basically hit the volley ball back and forth until someone misses it or hits it out of bounds. Simple? Yes! But still very fun. You also may have heard a rumor that that Kunio Volley Ball game kicks this game's ass in. Well, that rumor is just wrong. Sorry Kunio. Well-played, but you just FELL SHORT. This is the real thing folks. Because it's Sanrio. PLay it! It is commanded of you!Translation Description:In playtesting, I thought I found a couple of untranslated commentator things, but maybe I just dreamed it one night. And if I say so myself, the signs totally suck. Apart from that, it's a great game and it's in English. Go play the game now.Reviewer: wraithhttp://www.romhacking.net/trans/210/</plot>
