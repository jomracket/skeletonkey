	<Plot>When nightmares come to life... You discover you're not immortal! You're a mighty wizard in search of your lost master, Mordamir. Venture into the dungeon and slove the mysteries of each level. Unravel the secrets of The Immortal! The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game. Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await. The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.</Plot>
