	<ReleaseDate>2004</ReleaseDate>
	<Plot>In a time history forgot, the lands of Amaranth were shrouded in darkness and danger. From hidden caves forth to terrorize the small, peace-loving villages of the valleys. Most were powerless against the ravages of these minions of darkness. It was a time of locked doors and darkened windows, when people hid in their beds and prayed for an end to the night. In spite of these tales of dread, warriors, adventurers and treasure-hunters would still find their way to the caves to seek fortune and glory. Two of these treasure-hunters were known in the taverns and inns of Amaranth as Lex and Grim.</Plot>
