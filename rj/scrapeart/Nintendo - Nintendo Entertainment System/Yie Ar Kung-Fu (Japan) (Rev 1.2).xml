	<Name>Yie Ar Kung-Fu (Japan) (Rev 1.2)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Yie Ar Kung-Fu is a one-vs-one fighting game from Konami, and along with Karate Champ is considered one of the earliest pioneers of the genre. Players control Oolong (Lee in the NES version), who must fight all martial arts masters in the game to gain the name of "Grand Master" and honor the memory of his father. The player can combine directions and the two attack buttons (one for kick, one for punch) to land blows on their opponent.CharactersBuchuBuchu is a sumo wrestler who uses a leaping motion to land on the player. Buchu's size means he is a slow opponent though. Buchu does not use weapons to fight and he is the first opponent the player faces.StarStar is the first female opponent the player faces. She is a ninja dressed in pink who wields shuriken, which slow down the player, as well as an array of punches and kicksNunchaNuncha attacks the player with nunchuks, dressed in bright yellow. Like Star, his weapon can slow down the player.PoleNot surprisingly, Pole attacks the player with a pole, which he also uses to vault for extra speed and distance in his attacks.FeedleFeedle is an odd enemy, in that he replicates himself to attack the player from every side. Feedle is not present in the Commodore 64 and some other ports of the game.ChainChain starts off the second gauntlet. He attacks the player with a giant chain with a claw weapon attached to the end.ClubClub wields a large spiked club, and uses a shield to block the player's attacksFanAnother character whose name is their weapon, Fan throws steel fans at the character, and launches ferocious attacks.SwordSword uses a sword, and is adept at launching aerial attacks at the player.TonfunThe penultimate opponent, Tonfun tries to best the player using tonfa and martial arts. Key to victory is proper timing and waiting for openings in Tonfun's attacks.BluesBlues is the final opponent, and looks just like the player character, except he wears no shirt. After defeating Blues, the game starts over again at Buchu.

	<Notes>This version of Yie Ar Kung-Fu contains some significant differences compared to the versions directly ported from the original arcade release. For once, the hero of this game is not Oolong, but a fighter named Lee, inspired in appearance by the famous martial artist. All the opponents in this version are different as well; beside bearing other names, many of them also exhibit different fighting styles - for example, there is a character who throws fireballs, another one who can fly, etc. Altogether, there are only five possible opponents in this release, as opposed to ten in the other version. There is only one location (background) in the game, a kung-fu training hall. Gameplay-wise, this version retains the basic system of the original; however, due to the reduced number of opponents, there are less moves in the game. A distinct addition is a jump kick, and the ability to bounce off the walls.</Notes>
