	<plot>Stunt Kids is an unlicensed head-to-head dirt bike racing game featuring a pair of helmeted, yet clearly wide-eyed children. Two human players can compete head to head, or a computer can control the second player, as the kids race dirt bikes through increasingly difficult obstacle courses whilst collecting power-ups. The dirt bikes can jump and lean and the player needs to take advantage of the bike's abilities in order to avoid being thrown clear.Cheat: CHR RAM Smiley TestTo activate the CHR RAM "Smiley Test" easter egg for this game, you will need to power on the NES/Famicom console while holding Up, Down, Left, Right, B, Select, and Start. Note, however, that it is not normally possible to hold all four D-Pad buttons without specially modified controllers; standard NES/Famicom controllers will not work.</plot>
