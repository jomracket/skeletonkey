BMX SIMULATOR: Against-the-clock bike racing at its best. 15 all-action circuits across three different terrains - dirt biking, desert racing and quarry racing. The burns, bumps and ramps really work - get pedalling!Cheat: CHR RAM Smiley TestTo activate the CHR RAM "Smiley Test" easter egg for this game, you will need to power on the NES/Famicom console while holding Up, Down, Left, Right, B, Select, and Start. Note, however, that it is not normally possible to hold all four D-Pad buttons without specially modified controllers; standard NES/Famicom controllers will not work.</plot>
