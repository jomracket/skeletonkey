Successfully leaving the Arkanoid stage grants the player one of eight letters that make up a secret message: Once this message has been fully revealed, the player moves onto the next world with four worlds in total.Cheat: Continue after Game OverWhen at the Game Over screen, hold down any D-Pad button and the A Button. then press Start to continue from the stage you died in.</plot>
