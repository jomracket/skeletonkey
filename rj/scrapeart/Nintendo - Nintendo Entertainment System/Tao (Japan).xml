	<Notes>Tao (??, lit. "Road") is an adventure video game for the Nintendo Family Computer about living the life of a nomad seeking spiritual enlightenment. On the way to enlightenment, the player roams from town to town solving quests for various non-player characters during the year 1999. Along the way, the red-headed character develops an alter ego named Tao (which can be summoned by rubbing on a special piece of stone), they must prevent the apocalypse from occurring by accomplishing the necessary quests. Players also have to visit cities that are made out of gold in order to complete the game. There are elders and common folk outside the village that give out advice when leaving the town by walking on the railroad tracks. A Buddhist temple can be explored near the player's starting point.</Notes>
