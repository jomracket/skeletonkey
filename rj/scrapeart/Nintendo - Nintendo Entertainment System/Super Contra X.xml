	<Plot>Super Contra X is a pirate based off the Contra series, created by Chengdu Tai Jing Da Dong Computer Co sometime in the 1990's. (Likely 1994).  This isn't a complete clone of Contra or any games in the series, but instead tries to remake the engine and use it in completely different levels. Most of the weapons from that game are present, but function differently. The default gun is similar to the original, but sometimes pressing the fire button doesn't shoot a bullet when it's supposed to due to unresponsive controls. The machine gun fires slower and and doesn't allow you to fire while jumping. The spread gun only fires in three directions and the laser is more like the one from Contra 4 in that you can fire multiple shots on the screen at once and that the shots don't disappear when you fire repeatedly. Occasionally in certain spots, the player can die for no reason. Many consider the game to be incredibly difficult because of unresponsive controls and poor programming.</Plot>
