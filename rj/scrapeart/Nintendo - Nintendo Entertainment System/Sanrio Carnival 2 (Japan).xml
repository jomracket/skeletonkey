	<Name>Sanrio Carnival 2 (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Sanrio Carnival is just a hodge-podge of various puzzle games, such as "falling candy of doom," and "rearrange the picture" (better known to some as "Columns," and "Major Annoyance"). But, it throws in all those loveable Sanrio characters, which makes up for it being a mediocre game. Playing against the computer is entirely boring. However, finding another human player may inject some added fun. But then again, finding another person to play Nitendo is a game unto itself :-PTranslation Description:The translation is complete! And the title screen is kewl.Reviewer: wraithhttp://www.romhacking.net/trans/209/</plot>
