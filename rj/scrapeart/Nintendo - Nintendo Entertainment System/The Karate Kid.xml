	<Plot>Think you can handle a real Martial Arts challenge? Then how about guiding Daniel-San through the series of hazards, obstacles, and challenges that stand in his path? But don't think that just being able to fight will get you through. This time it's not enough to just punch, kick and jump... this time your total martial arts training will be put to the test. Your discipline and inner control could be what saves your life. You must prove that you are capable of thinking, reasoning, and reacting. Catching a fly with your chopsticks or splitting blocks of ice with your bare hand is just as important as fighting face to face with your enemy. This challenge will take you to the streets of L.A., the back roads of Okinawa and many strange areas beyond. Always keep your mind clear and remember all that you've been taught, and maybe... just maybe... you'll make it!</Plot>
