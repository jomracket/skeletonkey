<Notes>Sure, driving a real high performance car can be quite a blast. But where can you go to do vertical loops, high-speed races and high flying jumps? In Hard Drivin', that's where! Hard Drivin' is so real you'll feel like you're burning up the road in a high-powered car. Two tracks provide plenty of challenge - put the pedal to the metal on the Speed Track or get airborne on the radical Stunt Track! Jump a drawbridge! Do a 360 loop! The true 3D screen display will have you hanging on for dear life! If you lose it, you get to see an instant replay of your accident. Like the incredible arcade hit, this Hard Drivin' is looking for a few hard drivers. No license - or cars - required! Prototype leaked online in 2013.</Notes>
