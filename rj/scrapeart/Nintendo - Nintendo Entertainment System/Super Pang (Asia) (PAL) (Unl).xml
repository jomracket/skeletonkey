	<Notes>Super Pang was originally an arcade game released by Mitchell in 1990 in Japan. The game was then ported to the SNES console by Capcom, and released as Super Buster Bros. in 1992. Before that happened, Sachen and Thin Chen Enterprise released this unlicensed port, manufactured and distributed by themselves for the Famicom system in 1991. Unlike the original arcade game and its licensed port, the game does not feature co-op play, as the players simply take turns. Also missing from the original are the different modes of play (Panic mode and Tour mode).</Notes>
