	<plot>Overview:Shingen the Ruler, known in Japan as Takeda Shingen 2, is an NES turn-based strategy game in which the player takes the role of the Japanese warlord Shingen Takeda during the 16th century. The game was published by Hot-B in 1990. The player must build up their forces, form alliances, and do battle with other warlords of the era.In an unusual move, the label on the NES cartridge features an index detailing what each of the abbreviations in the in-game menus stand for. The decision to place such information directly on the cartridge itself is noteworthy due to the fact that when the game was published in North America, the top-loading variant of the NES had yet to exist. At the time, there was no way to read the label while playing the game.Cheat: 100 Gold Mines (Japanese Version)At the game menu, pick the second option from the second row. Then select the 1st option, choose 0000 and highlight "Yes" (first option). On controller 2, hold Left-Down + B and on controller 1, press A. If done right, the gold mines counter will increase to 100.Cheat: Get 10 Free LancersGo to the merchant and tap select 10 times, the screen should blink twice to confirm. You will recieve 10 free lancers.</plot>
