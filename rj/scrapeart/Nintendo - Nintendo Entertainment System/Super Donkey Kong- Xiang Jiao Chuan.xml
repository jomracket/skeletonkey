	<Plot>Super Donkey Kong - Xiang Jiao Chuan is a Donkey Kong Country bootleg for the Famicom. The developer is believed to be Chengdu Tai Jing Da Dong Computer Co with Liang Yi Productions as the publisher. While this game takes many elements from Donkey Kong Country, it's more of an original game than a port. The player can only choose to be either Donkey or Diddy Kong and you play through the whole game with only one. They lose a life after three hits as opposed to one as shown in the top left. (Which is not displayed anywhere on the HUD.) A jumps and the B button lets the character perform their attack (unlike the original, doing it while standing doesn't cause you to move), run, and pick up and throw barrels. The game is notorious for its controls: the jumping is considered to be awkward because jumping causes the Kong to move at a running pace and the player can only turn around when at the peak of the jump while jumping forwards, which makes it difficult to do precision jumps. Another issue is holding B doesn't automatically make you run; you need to complete your attack before you begin running. It's also been noted that the Kongs themselves feel rather slippery when attempting to stop, especially when running.</Plot>
