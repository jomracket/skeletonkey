	<plot>Woody Poko was a pretty mediocre Famicom game that was (unsurprisingly) never localized outside of Japan. It's a pretty simple adventure game in which you can walk and jump around, kill enemies, collect money and items, use those items to reach more locations and then progress through the game's levels.This hack was finished about a year before I ever actually released it anywhere. In the mean time, apparently someone translated the MSX version of the game, which is probably both a way better game and a way better translation hack. You should probably play that one, honestly.http://www.romhacking.net/trans/1477/Cheat: Start With Tons of CashAt the password screen, enter the number 4.

	<Notes>The player controls an old wooden figure named "This Baggage." He is a hero who has lived in harmony with humans for many years. For This Baggage, the journey is to find the fairy who teaches people to get back to being friendly with wooden dolls. Enemies encountered through the game are strange creatures and bothersome old men. The player attacks by using his fists at them. Players can steal the items in the store. But after stealing, the player's appearance is changed to resemble that of a thief. Hotels and pawn shops can no longer admit the player for the remainder of the game after a theft has taken place.</Notes>
