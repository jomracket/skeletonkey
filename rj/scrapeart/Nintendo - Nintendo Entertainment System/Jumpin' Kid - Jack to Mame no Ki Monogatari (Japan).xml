<Notes>Jumpin' Kid: Jack to Mame no Ki Monogatari (ジャンピン・キッド ジャックと豆の木ものがたり?, "Jumping Kid: The Tale of Jack and the Beanstalk") was released on December 19, 1990 in Japan for the Family Computer. A North American release was planned but ultimately scrapped. This video game is a variation of the famous fairy tale, Jack and the Beanstalk. It is a challenging platform game that plays similar to Mega Man. Beans help to improve the player's attack, while springs are used to improve his jumping height.</Notes>
