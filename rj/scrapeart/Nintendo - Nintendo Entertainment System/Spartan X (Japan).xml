	<plot>You'll need lightning fast reactions to knock out the Knife Thrower, stop the Stick Fighter, and trip up the evil Tom Tom Brothers in this action-packed martial arts contest! Are you sure you're tough enough? Because it'll take all your strength and skill to master the moves in KUNG FU, beat your opponents, and rescue the fair Sylvia who's held captive on the top floor! The action is non-stop, and just when you think you've got your enemies licked there's always a Giant, a Snake, or a fire-breathing Dragon to contend with in KUNG FU!Cheat: Extra PointsOn each stage kill eleven enemies. When you get to the twelfth enemy make sure to Jump Kick him. You will get 5000 points instead of the default point value of 200 for your Jump Kick. This trick will only work if the enemy you Jump Kick is a purple Gripper and also works for every twelfth enemy after.</plot>
