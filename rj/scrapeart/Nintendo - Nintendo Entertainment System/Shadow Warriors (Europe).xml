	<plot>The wind howls as the two "Dueling" Ninjas glare at each other in the moonlight. Though these men seem like little more than shadows in the air, the moonlight reveals just for an instant, a glint of light that proves to be the end of the contest. Ken, head of the Hayabusa clan which has for generations been the guardian of the Dragon sword, is defeated.Ken's son Ryu, after learning of his father's defeat, finds a letter. In it Ryu is told that if his father does not return, he must take the secret Dragon sword and go to America. Ryu senses danger awaiting him in America. What will be the fate of Ninja Ryu!?--From the NES Ninja Gaiden instruction manual.Overview::Ninja Gaiden is the first installment in a long and illustrious series. This game was super-popular in the arcade, and this is a pretty nice port. The graphics aren't as good as they were in the arcade, but the game-play is about the same. Ninja Gaiden was one of those games that would sell a bunch of copies just because it had the word 'ninja' in the title. It was still a great game, though. Cross classic side-scrolling platform with cool ninja magic and abilities, and you've got yourself a fun game. If you haven't played Ninja Gaiden, give it a try. Directions:Everybody is Kung Fu fighting! Use your ninja skills to clear the levels. Ryu can grab onto and jump from walls, so if you are falling there is still hope!Slash open objects to get power-ups, which you can use with Up-B. Controls:A Button: JumpB Button: AttackStart Button: PauseUp+B: Use PowerHints:Sound TestDuring the 'Tecmo Presents 1989' screen, hold Left, Down, Select, A, B and press Start. Reviewer: Adrianhttp://consoleclassix.com/nes/ninja_gaiden.htmlCheat: Sound TestWhen the screen says [I]Techmo Presents 1989[/I]:Cheat: Mid-air sword glitchNormally, you can only slash once or twice slowly with your sword during a jump. With this glitch, you can rapidly swing your sword multiple times in mid-air. To perform the glitch, jump in the air, hold 'down' on the d-pad while in the air, then swing your sword with 'B'. While still in the air, release the down button, then immediately hold the down button once more and attack again. You will swing your sword more rapidly than normal. You can repeat the process until you land. With enough practice, you can swing your sword up to 4 times in the air. This will only work while you're in the air. The glitch works very well with slow-moving or stationary bosses, allowing you to get in a few extra hits.Cheat: Extra livesIn Area 5-3, there's a 1UP on the 3rd floor of the tower. Then, go back down the ladder to the 2nd floor, and then back up to the 3rd floor. The 1UP will have returned. You can do this as many times as you want.</plot>
