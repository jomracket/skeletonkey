There, they seem to sell only five items: a Pennant, a Jelly, a Key Chain, a Wooden Sword, and a Bear Figurine. However, between the first two items (Pennant and Jelly) is a line, which has been left blank for some inconceivable reason. If you scroll to it and try to buy the "blank" item there, you will not have a blank item added to your inventory, but rather you will end up having purchased 12 Jelly items for 5,000 Rupees - the significance of this being that 12 Jellies, at 500 Rupees each (as they are listed in that shop), cost 6,000 Rupees, saving you 1,000 Rupees!</plot>
