	<Plot>California, 1938. It had been one heck of a week for ace air racer and stunt pilot Cliff Secord, a week that had drastically changed his life. After his stunt plane was wrecked accidentally in a shootout between a couple of thugs and G-Men, the hoods had stashed an amazing stolen device in his cockpit. It didn't take long to figure out it was a rocketpack. And it took even less time for Cliff to become a target for half the city. The hoods wanted the stolen device back. So did its inventor, the famous, but eccentric American industrialist, not to mention the FBI, the U.S. Army, and the most menacing force of all, the Nazis! Even famous film star Neville Sinclair wanted the rocketpack. He had kidnapped Cliff's girlfriend, the gorgeous Jenny Blake, and was offering to exchange her for the device. Cliff had no time to ponder his desperate situation. There was only one course of action; he must become THE ROCKETEER!</Plot>
