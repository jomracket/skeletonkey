	<Plot>Double the fun on one Game Pak - use the light gun for Duck Hunt and the controllers for Super Mario Bros.  Take aim, fire and score! It's Duck Hunt! Your trusty hunting dog wades into the marshes to flush out your prey. Your fingers tighten around your Zapper light gun. Suddenly, there's a duck in the air! You've only got three shots to bag this duck, and if you miss, even your dog laughs at you! But become a sharp-shooter, and you'll progress to the next round where two ducks fly up at the same time. And then you're on to the ultimate challenge: Clay Shooting. Where you'll compete in a wild clay-pigeon shooting contest! Play Duck Hunt and discover you can have lots of laughs and be challenged at the same time. Do you have what it takes to save the Mushroom Princess? You'll have to think fast and move even faster to complete this quest! The Mushroom Princess is being held captive by the evil Koopa tribe of turtles. It's up to you to rescue her from the clutches of the Koopa King before time runs out. But it won't be easy. To get to the princess you'll have to climb mountains, cross seas, avoid bottomless pits, fight of turtle soldiers and a host of black magic traps that only a Koopa King can devise. It's another non-stop adventure from the Super Mario Bros.!</Plot>
