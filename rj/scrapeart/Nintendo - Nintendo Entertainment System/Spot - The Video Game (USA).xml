	<Name>Spot - The Video Game (USA)</Name>
	<plot>SPOT is awesome... it's totally the wildest game ever... packed with features like: an 'on-screen' playfield designer that lets you customize your own game - 'zillions' of possibilities - or select your personalfavorite from the 512 pre-programmed options; Play 1, 2, 3 or 4 player modes, play against your friends, or take on the computer... you choose! The 5 selectable levels of computer skill will make for a never-ending challenge. Reset the move timer and get your opponents really jammin'! 35 animated moves make for cool mind-bending action! See SPOT breakdance! See SPOT dive! See SPOT moonwalk! Warning: Not recommended for squares, cos' it's hip to be cool with SPOT!Cheat: Display the CreditsHere's a neat little Easter Egg that was told to me by Graeme Devine, who co-wrote the game.  Set all four players to AI level 5, and just sit back and let the Nes play against itself.  Once the game is over, the ending cinema will display the credits instead of the usual ''(color) Wins!''</plot>
