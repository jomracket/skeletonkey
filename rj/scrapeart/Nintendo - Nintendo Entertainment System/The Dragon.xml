	<ReleaseDate>1995</ReleaseDate>
	<Plot>The player assumes the role of Bruce Lee, who uses Liu Kang's sprites. The levels are split into a platforming/action section and a one-on-one fighting section, with both sections using the same control mechanics. The end level boss is another character from Mortal Kombat 1 but is renamed in a ridiculous fashion. The bosses are made up of Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Sonya, Kano, &amp; Raiden. Cinema scenes before and after each level loosely refer to some of Bruce Lee's films. Besides the main story mode there is also a "battle" option, which allows you to select and fight any of the five level bosses in a best 2-out-of-3 match. There is no option for a 2nd human player to join, nor can you play as any of the other characters.</Plot>
