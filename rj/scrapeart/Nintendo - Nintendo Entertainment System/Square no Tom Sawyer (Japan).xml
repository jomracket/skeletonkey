	<plot>In 1855, Tom Sawyer and his friends are growing up in the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri in the United States. Being wild children, Tom Sawyer and his best friend Huckleberry Finn are always getting into new adventures and one kind of trouble or another. So it's not entirely unexpected one day when Tom Sawyer heads off to school and realizes he is late...Square no Tom Sawyer is a side-scrolling RPG that features characters and situations from Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer novels. Players control Tom himself and up to three other characters who can join his party at any one time. In town, there are a variety of people that can be talked to and shops where items can be bought and sold. Outside of towns, monsters and fierce woodland animals are randomly encountered and must be battled with. When entering battle mode, the game shifts to a third-person view behind Tom's party. The player can issue commands such as Fight, Item and Run to each of the characters in the party and these actions will occur in turn. Battles that are won earn the participating characters experience points. These experience points can be allocated to increase specific stats of characters. Players can accumulate new items for use in battle but never have to deal with equipping characters.Cheat: Sound TestInsert the code at the game's menu (where you choose whether to start, continue, or adjust the game's speed) using controller 2.Cheat: Special Name PasswordsBegin by entering one of the names from the table below as a master name for Tom - this can be done by starting a new game, pressing Select, then choosing the "Master" option and then the "Select" option.

	<Notes>Square's Tom Sawyer (スクウェアのトム・ソーヤ Sukuwea no Tomu Sōya?) is a role-playing video game for the Nintendo Family Computer (known internationally as the Nintendo Entertainment System) game console. The game is directly based on Mark Twain's renowned novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and was developed in the role-playing video game niche that made Square famous with its acclaimed Final Fantasy series of video games. The game is featured in GameSpy's retrospective overview of the Nintendo Famicom; Benjamin Turner and Christian Nutt's Square column concludes that "one of the most amusing Square games that didn't come [to the U.S.] was Square's Tom Sawyer, an RPG starring the happy-go-lucky boy wonder that featured a...racially insensitive...character."</Notes>
