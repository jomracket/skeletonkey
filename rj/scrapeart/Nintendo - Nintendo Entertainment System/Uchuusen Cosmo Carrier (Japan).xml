The interactions allowed are:  Missile, Beam, Shiled(SIC), Move, Communicate, Computer, Parts, and State. Missile launches a rocket with adjustable strength at your target.

	<Notes>When the moon departed from its usual orbit sometime in the year 1999, Nostradamus' prediction finally become true. A huge squadron of spaceships piloted by hostile alien forces came out of an artificial planet constructed near Pluto. A ragtag defense force has been assembled by the leaders of humanity in the hopes of being able to fend of the invasion. Only a photon missile, invented by the extraterrestrials themselves, can destroy this fake planet and bring a halt to this invasion. The earth only has 100 days left to live unless the commander of the Cosmo Carrier can succeed in his duties.</Notes>
