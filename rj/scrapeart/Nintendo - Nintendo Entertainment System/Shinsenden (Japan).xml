	<plot>Yep, Dragon Quest clone. This has a lot more promise than others that I've seen, only because the intro's pretty cool, and I'm a sucker for stuff with an Eastern influence. Yeah, so go Shinsenden! Whee!Translation Description:Another "oriental" style Role Playing Game for NES.  Please, check README (at website) and feel free to take a look at the complementary Info file, if you have some time and knowledge.http://www.romhacking.net/trans/1420/Cheat: Secret World MapAfter beating the game, start again and select the "load" option and this will load the game at the last save. Enter the "Endless Cave" and this is now a portal to a new location. All areas of the world map are now joined up and all enemies can be found and fought again, including the bosses.</plot>
