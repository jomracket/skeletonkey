	<Name>Galactic Protector (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Galactic Protector is a spin-off of the Fantasy Zone series, taking the spaceship star of that game Opa Opa and transporting him to space. The goal of the game is to defend the centrally located (and anthropomorphized) planet from a series of alien spacecraft and asteroids. If the planet is hit too many times, the game ends. Each level features a different planet from the Solar System, each with their own characteristics - for instance, Jupiter has a gray mustache.Opa Opa is controlled with a special paddle controller and is fixed in Earth orbit. This creates a defensive Pong-type situation present in games like Atari's Warlords. As with Warlords, the player cannot let anything slip past them too many times.While shooting down enemies, the planet's panicked facial expressions will provide hints as to where the next enemy will appear from.</plot>

	<Notes>Galactic Protector is a Sega Master System shoot-'em-up game developed and published by Sega. It stars Opa Opa of Fantasy Zone and Zillion fame, who must save various planets from enemies and debris hurtling towards them. The game is built specifically for the Paddle Control, and therefore cannot be played on a standard Master System Control Pad. This also makes emulating the game tricky. Like the Paddle Control itself, Galactic Protector was not released outside of Japan. It was released as part of the Fantasy Zone Complete Collection for the PlayStation 2, also Japan only.</Notes>
