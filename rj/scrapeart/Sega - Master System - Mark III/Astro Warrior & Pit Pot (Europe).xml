	<plot>Two super hits in one!Turn back the invaders and save the galaxy in ASTRO WARRIOR.Can you find your way safely through the magical mazes in PIT POT?Cheat: During the game, when "Galaxy Zone," "Asteroid Zone," or "Nebula Zone" appear on the screen, quickly tap Buttons 1 and 2, alternating. It is VERY difficult to get it to work as the tempo needs to be just right, but when it does you will access the options screen.Cheat: Whenever you finish off a level and the name of the next level is on the screen, hit 1 and 2 alternately about 25-30 times total.  If you are fast and don't double hit one of the buttons, you'll get those 2 purple firing drones to begin the next stage with.Cheat: In the Main Menu, put the cursor on the Beginner option and press Right, Left, Left, Left, Right, Right, Left, Right, Left.  Now you can turn on: infinite lives / no enemies.</plot>
