	<plot>Overview:Krusty's Fun House (or Krusty's Super Fun House) is a puzzle game in which Krusty the Clown, of The Simpsons fame, is trying to eradicate all the rodents in his titular fun house. The goal is to convince the rats to march towards the machines that will eliminate them (staffed by Bart and Homer Simpson, as well as Krusty Show characters Sideshow Mel and Corporal Punishment) by using objects found in the vicinity. Like the Lemmings from the series of the same name, the rats will simply follow a set of rules defined by their programming and the player can use this to anticipate their actions and plan accordingly in order to trap them.The game was based on Audiogenic's earlier Amiga game Rat-Trap, which was licensed out to Acclaim so they could turn it into a The Simpsons licensed game. Acclaim published the game on almost every platform imaginable at the time, sub-licensing the home computer versions to Virgin Games.Cheat: Level PasswordsThere are 5 levels you can open with codes, NA and EU codes are different.Cheat: All doors are openEnter the appropriate password to go to the desired level: </plot>

	<Notes>Hey, kids! Give a hoot! Help out your old pal Krusty the Clown! My official Krusty's Fun House is infested with rats! I've got my loyal cadet Bart Simpson to guard the rat traps, but I need you to lead the filthy rodents into those traps! Then we blow 'em up! We laser-blast 'em! We Krusterize the little stinkers! Hoo boy! Making Krusty's Fun House vermin-free is not a pretty task, kiddy cadets - but someone's gotta do it!</Notes>
