	<plot>Overview:Hoshi wo Sagashite... (either "Searching the Stars" or "Story of Mio", the latter being the preferred alternate) is an adventure game in the Portopia mold, popular in Japan during the mid-to-late 80s. The initial goal of the game is to meet with the hero's girlfriend on her home planet, but the game quickly escalates from there.The game is controlled via a menu of options and occasionally a cursor that allows the player to make specific selections, such as a particular person or item on screen that they wish to interact with in some way. The menu is also how the main character moves from one area to the next. To progress in the game, the player needs to solve puzzles using items or talking to the right people to further the plot, much like in any other text or graphic adventure game.Cheat: EndingsThere are 3 endings depending on the Crystal.</plot>
