	<Name>Great Basketball (World)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Released on the same day as its Volleyball counterpart, Great Basketball recreates the sport for Sega Master System owners. It was the first basketball game for either the Sega Master System or the NES. It's also notable for its early use of sound samples and a rather gratuitous half-time show in the form of a cheerleader routine.Gameplay:The game is viewed from the side in a similar manner as Double Dribble or NBA Jam and plays much like those games and other basketball sims: The character with the ball must get it to the end of the court (either on his own or by passing it between teammates) and place it in the basket to score points all the while avoiding the defending team. The game used one button to pass and the other to shoot.The player can choose one of eight national teams: USA, Canada, USSR, Japan, Cuba, Czechoslovakia (as it wouldn't become two separate nations until 1993), Italy and Hungary.</plot>

	<Notes>This is basketball at the professional level. Full of international competition from the first jump ball to the last jump shot. Whether it's four on three or three on two - the action is fast and furious. And there are no favorites in this demanding play. You'll be called for double dribbling, cheered for every slam-dunk and carried off the court for making the winning free throw. But so will your opponent. So go for it. Your tough offense can put a "fast break" in the opposing team's stride while your defense remains solid as a rock. But think fast - because two can play at this game - and only one can win!</Notes>
