	<Notes>Janggun-ui Adeul (??? ??) is an unlicensed beat-'em-up game released in South Korea for the Sega Master System. It was at one point planned for a Sega Game Gear release in North America as Street Hero[1], but the plans fell through. A prototype has since emerged. The game is based on the South Korean film with the same name, which can be translated like General's Son (or Son of the General).</Notes>
