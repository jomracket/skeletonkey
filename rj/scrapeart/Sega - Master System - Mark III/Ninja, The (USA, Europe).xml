Gyokuro has the Ohkami ninja under control at his command. Utilizing various ninjitsu techniques, in addition to the one that transforms them into a wolf, they protect him from the people who are his enemies.You play Kazamuru, a great warrior who challenges the clan to a fight in order to rescue the princess. However, he can't rescue the princess unless he finds the five scrolls in the thirteen areas of Ohkami.
