Geraldinho is an infantile version of another comic character, Geraldo (both drawn by the Brazilian cartoonist Glauco). He is a boy addicted to soft drinks, ice cream and TV, and he's always with his friends, the dog Cachorro and the cat Tufinho.In this platform game, Geraldinho must defeat enemies using his ray gun. The enemies will come out of dice-faced boxes, and there will be as much enemies as shown at the box face. Once they are shot, they are turned into little balls, which must be quickly collected. If they're are not collected in a short period of time, they will turn into little creatures which will steal away time. Once all enemies are defeated, Geraldinho will proceed to the next level.If Geraldinho stands for too long on a platform, it will disintegrate, causing him to fall to the platform below. Sometimes this is the only way to get out of some closed places.From time to time Geraldinho will also play a bonus game, in which he must shoot boxes to get objects inside them. He must also avoid boxes with those little stealing time creatures.Cheat: Access Cheat MenuIn the title screen, press Up, Down, Left, Right on the control pad.Cheat: Access Cheat MenuIn the title screen, press Up, Down, Left, Right on the control pad to access a secret cheat menu.

	<Notes>Geraldinho is a retooled version of Teddy Boy, produced by Tec Toy and released exclusively in Brazil. The main character was replaced by "Geraldinho", a popular comics character created by Glauco Villas Boas, a famous brazillian illustrator and cartoonist, for children's section of the newspaper "Folha de SÃ£o Paulo" called "Folhinha". This game was another attempt of Tec Toy to suit the brazilian children audience, using characters from popular comics, series and magazines and, even though people generally don't have the game in their top lists, everyone in Brazil who lived in the 90's remembers of it with much affection. This version gives the player five lives to start with, while the original game gives only three.</Notes>
