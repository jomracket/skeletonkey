	<Name>Fushigi no Oshiro Pit Pot (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:The fourth game to be released for the Sega Master System (or Sega Mark III as it was known in Japan), Pit Pot was actually released in Western territories a year later as part of a bundle with Astro Warrior.While it greatly resembles The Legend of Zelda in regard to its overhead view and how it generally plays, it was actually released several months before Nintendo's groundbreaking title.Gameplay:The goal of the game is to direct the diminutive knight protagonist through a series of rooms finding treasure and keys to proceed. There are three special items in particular that the player needs to find to complete the game: A potion, a cross and a ring. The knight's mallet weapon can crush enemies in close range and also take out the gray floor tiles that make up the center of each room, making it harder to navigate but also cutting off enemies coming from that direction.The trick is to keep moving, as enemies will constantly respawn and the knight's lives are limited, and find as much of the treasure as possible: Reaching the somewhat avaricious princess without enough treasure will result in a non-standard game over.Cheat: Infinite Lives and/or No EnemiesIn the Main Menu, put the cursor on the Beginner option and press Right, Left, Left, Left, Right, Right, Left, Right, Left.  Now you can turn on: infinite lives / no enemies.</plot>
