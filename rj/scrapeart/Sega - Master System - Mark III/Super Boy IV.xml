	<Plot>Super Boy 4 is the fourth and supposedly final game in the Super Boy series by Zemina. Super Boy 4 again changes Super Boy's design, this time not being based off of Mario. The graphics, however, are still ripped from Super Mario World but with reduced color depth due to the Master System's technical limitations. Despite this, they are an improvement on Super Boy 3's due to the Master System having better graphical capabilities than the MSX or SG-1000. All sound effects and some of the songs are recycled from Super Boy 3. The game's items, unlike the first three games, are not randomized.</Plot>
