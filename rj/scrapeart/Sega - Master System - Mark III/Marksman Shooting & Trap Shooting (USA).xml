	<Name>Marksman Shooting & Trap Shooting (USA)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:The Sega Light Phaser was a light gun periphery device intended to compete with Nintendo's NES Zapper. Upon its release it was included with this professional target shooting simulator that allowed the player to shoot down clay pigeons (in Trap Shooting) and moving cardboard silhouette targets (in Marksman Shooting). The two games superficially resembled Duck Hunt and Hogan's Alley respectively.In the European-only mode Safari Hunt, the player could also shoot wild animals as they move across the screen. The creatures ranged from small fish and rabbits to larger beasts like bears, which required more than one shot to defeat. Defeated animals, rather than simply dying, tended to run off the screen with crosses through them to indicate they had been hit.</plot>

	<Notes>MARKSMAN SHOOTING puts you in training with the FBI. When the clock starts ticking, the targets start jumping, you start shooting. No time to panic. Too late to call it off. If you hit more than the designated number of targets you get to move on to another nerve-wracking round. TRAP SHOOTING demands a keen eye and faultless split-second reactions. As you tramp through the muddy grasslands, or a dense forest, you must keep your wits in this realistic clay pigeon shooting game. Only dead-on shots will let you go to the next round.</Notes>
