	<Name>Great Football (World)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:The final game in the Great sports series, Great Football covers Football (or American Football). It had an alternate release as Sports Pad Football, which required the use of the Sega Sports Pad accessory. It was released on the same day as Great Volleyball and Great Basketball in Japan.Though the player can choose between the AFC and NFC conferences, the teams are entirely invented and have names like "the Beavers" or "the Knights".Gameplay:The game plays like a regular game of football with one exception: The computer never plays offense, leaving the player in full control of the ball at all times. However, the computer initially begins with a certain number of points which the player must beat in order to win. Otherwise, it plays like a regular football game: The player must pick a formation/play from a list of available options and then find a way to get the ball as far downfield as possible, preferably to the endzone where they can score some points with a touchdown.</plot>

	<Notes>Playoff fever grips you. And no wonder. You're the driving force that can take your football team to the top in this rough and tumble contest between the leagues. The outcome of the game is in your hands. As the quarterback, you select the plays. Line up the formations. Call the signals and carry the ball. Cut down your opponent with deadly blocking. Intercept a pass. Make a flying tackle. All you need is skill. Strategy. Cunning. And nerve. For non-stop action that charges across the screen. You decide to pass. It looks good. Touchdown!</Notes>
