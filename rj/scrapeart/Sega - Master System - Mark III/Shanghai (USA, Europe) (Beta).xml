	<Name>Shanghai (USA, Europe) (Beta)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Shanghai is a board game where the goal is to remove tiles from the board by selecting pairs of currently "free" tiles, defined as any tile with a side free (other than the front) that can be removed from the table without disturbing its neighboring tiles. If the player is able to remove every tile on the board without getting stymied by locked tiles, they win the game. Though circles, bamboos, characters and dragons must be removed in identical pairs, a flower can be paired off with any other flower and the same is also the case for seasons. This is because there is only one flower/season tile each.Shanghai is frequently mistaken for the game of Mahjong, which is considerably more in-depth and plays more like the card game Rummy. Since Shanghai uses the same tileset as Mahjong and it is a one-player game, it is often called Mahjong Solitaire.This particular version was created in the late-80s and ported to various systems courtesy of Activision. Sunsoft is credited as responsible for the Famicom version, which was only available in Japan.Cheat: Blank TilesIn title screen, press Pause 10x, then start the game.Cheat: Blank TilesPress Pausex10 at the title screen, then begin game play.

	<Notes>Steady your nerves and concentration. You're about to play Shanghai! Shanghai is based on an ancient game that's over 25 centuries old. Over the years since, it has been a favorite of pirates and smugglers, flappers and gangsters, of working men and the well-to-do. Now you can play it too, on the Sega System. The game is simple... the strategy complex. Remove 144 tiles from a pyramid; two matching tiles at a time. But be careful. Remove the wrong two tiles and you're left with no more matching pairs... game over! It's a game everyone can play and enjoy.</Notes>
