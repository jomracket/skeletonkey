	<Notes>Street Master is an unlicensed port of Street Fighter I. It also sports a few challengers from Street Fighter II. The five enemies are Joe, Chun Li, "Ninja" (for some reason they dropped Geki's name), Bison (the boxer, in his SFII-attire) and Gen. The player always takes the role of Ken, Ryu isn't available (although the sprite is actually colored like him). In 2-player mode the second player, who fights on the left side in this game, gets to chose between the 5 enemies. Player one is denied that privilege, though.</Notes>
