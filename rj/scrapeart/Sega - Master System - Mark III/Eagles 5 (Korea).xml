	<Name>Eagles 5 (Korea)</Name>
	<plot>Eagles 5 is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up loosely based on the Japanese anime series Gatchaman. Characters from the anime are featured on the game's cover and in the background story; however, in the game itself the player controls a spaceship flying through deep space levels with identical background. The ship is protected by a shield, which effectively grants it a HP bar. Power-ups that upgrade the ship's weaponry can be found in the stages. However, the weapon reverts to its default shape when the ship is hit by the enemy. There are no continues in the game: when the ship's hit points are depleted, the game must be restarted from the beginning.</plot>
