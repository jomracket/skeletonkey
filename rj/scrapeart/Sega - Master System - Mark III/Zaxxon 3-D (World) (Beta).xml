	<Name>Zaxxon 3-D (World) (Beta)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Zaxxon 3-D uses the Master System 3D Glasses, a pair of stereoscopy-enhanced glasses that were used with a handful of Sega Master System games. Fortunately, there is a menu option to play the game in regular 2D for player who don't own the peripheral.Unlike the original Zaxxon, the game takes a "behind the ship" viewpoint, similar to that of Space Harrier, rather the original Arcade game's isometric perspective. Otherwise, it is largely identical to Sega's venerable shooter - simply shoot down enemies, avoid obstacles such as walls by flying over them and defeat bosses at the end of each level.Cheat: Options MenuAt the title screen press the pause button. This will bring you to an options menu that will allow you to change the view from 3-D to 2-D (useful for those that don't have 3-D glasses), and to invert up/down controls.</plot>
