	<Name>Great Soccer (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Great Soccer is the first game in Sega's Great sports series. It was released in 1985 in Japan and later in 1986 in Europe. It did not receive a US release, though its sequel World Soccer did. The US release of World Soccer is what US players know as the game Great Soccer. The game was one of the few to be released on the Sega Mark III's early card format, before the system moved to higher capacity cartridges.The game is played with a vertical field perspective, where the goals are situated at the top and bottom of a vertically-scrolling screen. This is entirely different to World Soccer (World)/Great Soccer (US), in which the field is horizontal.Cheat: Stop every Penalty KickIt's very easy to stop any penalty kick when you are the goalkeeper. Simply PAUSE the Master System when the player shoots and you see where the ball will go. Then, prepare the D-pad, unpause the game and stop it.</plot>
