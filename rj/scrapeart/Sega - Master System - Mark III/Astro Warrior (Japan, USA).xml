	<plot>Basic Sega shoot-em-up in which you must guide your ship through three zones while avoiding hazards. Your only weapon are bullets as your only defense, but if you shoot the flashing red pieces on the terrain, chances are that a green ship will approach you, and if you collect this ship, your weapons will be upgraded so that you shoot a laser beam instead. Keep collecting ships and you can shoot up to three laser beams at once. At the end of each zone, you will come across a boss that takes multiple hits to kill. If you manage to conquer all three zones, you are back to where you started. The whole point of this game is to earn as many points you can without losing all of your lives.Cheat: Secret Options ScreenDuring the game, when "Galaxy Zone," "Asteroid Zone," or "Nebula Zone" appear on the screen, quickly tap Buttons 1 and 2, alternating. It is VERY difficult to get it to work as the tempo needs to be just right, but when it does you will access the options screen.Cheat: Start new levels with dronesWhenever you finish off a level and the name of the next level is on the screen, hit 1 and 2 alternately about 25-30 times total.  If you are fast and don't double hit one of the buttons, you'll get those 2 purple firing drones to begin the next stage with.</plot>
