	<plot>HANG ON is the 3D motorcycle race game that's taken the arcades by storm. Race through grasslands, seasides, valleys, nighttime city scapes and, of course, motorcycle racecourses. This game is so fast it even gives you special racing techniques like Hang On and Countersteering for taking the corners. ASTRO WARRIOR pits you against the enemy's fleet of superpowered spaceships. And ultimately, the invincible Master Ship. In this treacherous black universe you can only count on yourself. To shoot fast. To shoot straight. If you do - you get more power. More weapons. To beat the villains. To beat the odds. If you don't - the odds beat you.Cheat: During the game, when "Galaxy Zone," "Asteroid Zone," or "Nebula Zone" appear on the screen, quickly tap Buttons 1 and 2, alternating. It is VERY difficult to get it to work as the tempo needs to be just right, but when it does you will access the options screen.Cheat: Whenever you finish off a level and the name of the next level is on the screen, hit 1 and 2 alternately about 25-30 times total.  If you are fast and don't double hit one of the buttons, you'll get those 2 purple firing drones to begin the next stage with.</plot>
