	<Name>F-16 Fighting Falcon (Taiwan)</Name>
	<plot>It's dog-eat-dog in the wild blue yonder. This is the most perilous dogfight ever to explode on the video screen. It's between an F-16 (you!) and a MIG-25 plane. Your F-16 is a multipurpose fighter. But the MIG-25 was built for speed. So it's going to take everything you've got to catch up with her. But then, 'everything you've got' is quite a lot. Your F-16 can fly as high as 50,000 feet. It has a top speed of 1,450 mph. And missiles and cannons are just part of its standard armament. Its fully advanced electronic control pad supplies you with a wealth of valuable flight information. It even includes an automatic homing device as well as ECMs (electronic countermeasures). This is simulated flight at its most realistic. And simulated battle at its most deadly.Cheat: Stage SelectPress Button 1 to start a new game and when ''Level 01'' appears on the screen, press up or down to change the stage.</plot>
