	<plot>Overview:Monopoly is a board game for multiple platforms. The game varies greatly in visuals, sound, and extras depending on the platform.Gameplay:Monopoly is a popular board game by Parker Brothers, with a simple object: Be the last player standing by bankrupting all others. The gameplay is simple, in turn, each player rolls the dice, and moves that player's token the indicated number of spaces clockwise. The players can buy properties, railroads, and utilities in an attempt to speed up the bankrupting process. If all properties of a certain color are acquired, a monopoly is gained, and houses and hotels may be built on those properties. These houses and hotels can drastically increase the money others have to give the owner of these properties, or rent. Since there is only one of each deed per game, trading with other places is pretty much vital to winning.</plot>

	<Notes>Monopoly is fantastic fun for the entire family. You can play against the computer - with skill levels you select - or get up to 10 players in on the action. It has special features such as a built-in battery so you can save games and play them later. Roll the dice with a push of a button. Your token comes to life and moves around the board! Buy companies and properties. Increase the value of your properties by building houses and hotels. Land on "Chance" or "Community Chest" and pick a card. With strategy and luck, you can become a winner. But you never know how the dice will roll!</Notes>
