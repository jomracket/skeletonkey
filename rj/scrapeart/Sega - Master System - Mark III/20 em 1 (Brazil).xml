Another pong game: this time the player is at a squash court. He must try to hit the ball as much as he can until the time runs out. He has 3 balls.In order to win, the player must score a certain amount of points in each game (which vary from game to game). If the player scores less the specified amount, he loses. In the "catch the object" and shooter games (1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17), points are earned by catching or shooting objects. In racing games (3, 7, 8, 9, 14, 18 and 19), points are earned by the distance ran. In game 15 points are earned by hitting the oven; in game 20, by number of hits in the ball. In these games (15 and 20), the player can loose if he misses all his balls/pizzas. In game 4 no points are earned at all, and you'll loose if the character gets stuck and the screen scrolls over him.The game has only two songs, one played at the title screen, the other played during all gameplay. All the text in the game is in Portuguese.</plot>
