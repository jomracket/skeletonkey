	<Name>Tensai Bakabon (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:Tensai Bakabon ("Genius Bakabon") is based on the manga and anime of the same name, a comedic slice-of-life comic strip that has long since shifted its focus from the original main character, a dull-witted young boy, to the more appealing character of his rather crazy and stubborn Papa.The game has sparse sequences where Papa can jump, shoot enemies and fight with random NPCs, but the game is largely about exploration and talking to NPCs, like in any text/graphic adventure game.Cheat: Hidden Japanese Word.Once you obtain the secret of accessing the underground tunnels by jumping on the manholes three times (you must buy a drink from the bar which you get kicked out then go back in and by a beer to do so). Go inside the first tunnel and the rocks in this area will be arranged to spell out Bakabon in Japanese Katakana.Cheat: Easy 50,000 yenWhenever you are walking on the street, there is a character that is seen running wildly. Touch him to engage a conversation and choose "strike" (middle option) to beat him up and get 10,000 yen. You can strike him up to five times for a total of 50,000 yen every time you encounter him.</plot>
