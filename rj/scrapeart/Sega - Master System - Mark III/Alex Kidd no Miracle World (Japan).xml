It works on that version at least.When you get the Game over screen (which happens way too often to make the game any fun...) you can continue if you hold up and hammer the 2 button about a dozen times before the game actually resets.  It costs $400 to do.Cheat: ContinueThis is how to beat the Janken bosses when you play against them, without having to fight them if you lose. 1st: Choose Rock in the first game, then Scissors in the second 2nd: Scissors, then Paper 3rd: Rock, Scissors 4th: Paper, Paper 5th: Rock, Rock  6th: Rock, Scissors 7th: Paper, Paper (Must be done in that order from the start of the game, if you choose one different along the way all the rest will be different)</plot>
