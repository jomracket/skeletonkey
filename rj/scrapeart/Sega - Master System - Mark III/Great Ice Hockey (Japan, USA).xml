	<Name>Great Ice Hockey (Japan, USA)</Name>
	<plot>Welcome to the Big Leagues. Here's a rough and tumble hockey game that takes a steady hand and quick reflexes. Because your mean opponents mean business. Teams line up in full defense. Tackle one another. Scramble for the puck. Drive relentlessly for a goal. Victory for your team depends on you. So you need sharp techniques. Quickness. Power. And smooth stick-shifting ability. Show you have the right touch, hit the puck straight into the goal. But just relax your guard, and see why they call the game of hockey 'wrestling on ice.'</plot>
