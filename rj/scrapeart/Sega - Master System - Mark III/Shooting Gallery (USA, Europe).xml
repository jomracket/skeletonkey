	<Name>Shooting Gallery (USA, Europe)</Name>
	<plot>Using your Sega Light Phaser, you are given a specified length of time to shoot as many targets as you can before the music fades out. The targets include birds, balloons, blimps, balls, and spaceships; some difficult, some not so difficult. As you progress through the rounds, the game gets difficult. For example, in Levels 3 &amp; 4, you have to shoot balls that pass through a set of pipes and come out the other end, and on Level 5, you can't shoot the spaceships if they are protected by a shield, and have to wait until the shield disappears, but not for long. The game ends when you don't shoot enough targets.</plot>

	<Notes>If you think this is just another shoot 'em up game, think again. Nothing demands more skill, more daring, more intense gameplay than SHOOTING GALLERY! And hopefully, you've got what it takes to survive. A keen eye. A steady hand. And the invincible Sega Light Phaser that actually records misses. If you aim straight and aim on target, just maybe you'll be able to shoot everything from iron-clad Spaceships to incredibly fast Blimps. But don't despair if the going gets tough. Because it gets tough for everyone.</Notes>
