	<Name>Missile Defense 3-D (USA, Europe)</Name>
	<plot>The east and west are attacking!  ICBM's and cruise missiles are flying, and it's your job to intercept them from a laser cannon positioned in space.  You have 3 chances to save each city.  Scene 1: Launch.  Shoot as many as possible from their launch point.  If you miss any, you can catch up with them in scene 2.  Scene 2: However many you missed in the previous scene, you have another chance to shoot them down.  If you miss them again, you have one final chance to catch them in scene 3.  Scene 3: The City - This is the last chance.  You must shoot them ALL down, if even one gets through, the game is over.  The game starts off fairly easy, but quickly ramps up in speed and the number of missiles launched.</plot>

	<Notes>War has been declared between two super powers. At play are real nuclear missiles and the outcome looks dim. If their missiles make contact, there's no chance for survival. Luckily there's hope. You and The Eliminator, the only anti-nuclear laser in operation. Aboard a fugitive space station, you're armed for intervention and your mission is clear: stop all nuclear missiles. But it won't be easy. Because those missiles are being launched at you, too. So play for keeps. This is the most important challenge you may ever face.</Notes>
