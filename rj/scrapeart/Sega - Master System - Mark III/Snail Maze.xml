	<Plot>Snail Maze is a hidden Sega Master System game, which is available in the BIOS screen of any original model Master System console. It is accessed by holding 1, 2 and Up at the Sega logo, assuming you do not have a cartridge inserted. The feature was removed in the later Master System II models, as well as models which include either Sonic the Hedgehog or Alex Kidd in Miracle World built in. In the game the player must guide a snail around a maze within a time limit. When the player reaches the goal, a new maze scrolls in. Snail Maze was included in the Coleco Sonic handheld system released in 2006 and a fan release was made for the MSX computer in 2004.</Plot>
