	<Name>Rescue Mission (USA, Europe)</Name>
	<plot>Overview:The goal of Rescue Mission is to provide covering fire as a medic uses a hand-cart to reach different wounded soldiers and stitch up their injuries. The medic is assaulted on all sides from enemy troops, which the player must shoot down before the medic is killed. Though the medic has three lives, in actuality there are three different medics - when one dies, he is gone for good and the next one replaces him. The player must also be careful to not shoot the injured soldiers themselves, though once healed these soldiers leave behind useful healing items.Unlike most Sega games, Rescue Mission was never released in Japan. Light gun games fared a lot better outside the Sega Master System's home nation.</plot>
