	<plot>Overview:Satellite 7 is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up developed and published by Sega for their SG-1000 Mark III console, later dubbed the Sega Master System. It joined a handful of Sega-developed exclusives in late 1985, a few months after the console's launch, including another shoot 'em up Astro Flash (a.k.a. TransBot). Unlike most Sega Master System games, Satellite 7 was never released outside of Japan.Gameplay:The goal of Satellite 7 is to make it to each of the game's bosses and defeat them. The player can find stars which unlock power-ups once five of the same color have been collected, which can include a temporary burst of invincibility. The ship is equipped with both air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, like Namco's Xevious.Cheat: InvincibleTo enable Invincibility, pause the game and press 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2.</plot>
