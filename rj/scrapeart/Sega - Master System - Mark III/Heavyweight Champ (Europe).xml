	<Notes>Sega released several games in the arcade and console market with the title of "Heavyweight Champ" or with similar games re-branded with famous fighters of the time. Some of those versions were a "behind-the-boxer perspective" similar to Nintendo's "Punch-Out" series. However, for this console version the action is side to side with the player controlling the boxing character by throwing punches and moving left or right in the boxing ring.</Notes>
