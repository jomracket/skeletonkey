	<plot>Overview: Super Robot Wars Compact 2 was the second        Super Robot Wars strategy RPG to be released on the WonderSwan. Like       Super Robot Wars F/     F Final before it, Compact 2 is split into multiple parts:  Part 1 and     Part 2 occur simultaneously, while Part 3 continues from Part 2. Using the WonderSwan's internal memory, players  can send their clear data to each successive game; several events are  altered based on the player's previous save, gained items are carried  over to Part 3, and a special final scenario can be unlocked by clearing  the entire trilogy within 777 turns. The game, like   its predecessor,  borrows almost all of its gameplay mechanics from F/F Final; however,  it introduces the "Support System" which immediately became a core  mechanic of the SRW franchise.      The entirety of Compact 2 was remade into  Super Robot Wars Impact for the PlayStation 2.Story:As the asteroid (introduced in Compact 2-2) approaches Earth, Londo Bell worries that they may not have enough power to destroy it. Meanwhile, both Kyosuke and Excellen receive a message from the Einsts, causing Kyosuke to worry about his girlfriend. Excellen falls into a hypnotic state, and abruptly leaves the Ra Cailum.The Gandol is able to make contact with the Ra Cailum, and the dragon-battleship moves to unite with Londo Bell. However, the Einst appear in what seems to be an attempt to stop the infiltration of the asteroid...Featured Series A list of the anime series which are featured in the game.
