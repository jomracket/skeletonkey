	<Name>Soccer Yarou! - Challenge the World (Japan)</Name>
	<plot>Like Coconuts Japan Entertainment Co., Ltd.'s other WonderSwan title Soccer Yarou! ~Challenge The World~ can largely be summed up by it's title; you will pick one of many global soccer teams and set off on a crusade against the rest.The player controls a single one of their chosen team's members. The AI clumsily takes care of the rest. The player's selected splinter of the team avatar will move in the direction the player presses while dribbling the ball, should it be in his possession. When a button is pressed the ball will be kicked, should fortune spare your 2.49 inch screen a glance, to another player on your team. If another team member gets the ball you will automatically switch to that player. Kicking the ball is achieved by pressing a button which will more likely cause the player's character to fall on his face.A penalty shot mini-game is included where the view shifts to behind the player making the shot.</plot>
